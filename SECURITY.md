## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Cloud Users (core.heysol.ai)

- Use strong, unique passwords for your account
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Review connected applications and integrations regularly
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Keep your API keys and access tokens secure

### For Self-Hosted Deployments

- Follow our [Security Hardening Guide](docs/SECURITY_HARDENING.md)
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Regularly update dependencies and base images
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use strong authentication mechanisms
- Secure your database and Redis instances
- Implement network security controls (firewalls, VPNs)

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- **In Transit**: All data is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- **At Rest**: Sensitive data including tokens are encrypted using AES-256
- **Database**: Personal access tokens are stored with cryptographic hashing

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google)
- Magic link authentication for passwordless login
- Personal Access Tokens for API access
- Workspace-based isolation and access controls

### Infrastructure Security
