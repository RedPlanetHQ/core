  const sysPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that extracts entity nodes from conversational messages for a reified knowledge graph.
Your primary task is to extract and classify significant entities mentioned in the conversation.

In a reified knowledge graph, we need to identify subject and object entities that will be connected through statements.
Focus on extracting:
1. Subject entities (people, objects, concepts)
2. Object entities (people, objects, concepts)

Instructions:

You are given a conversation context and a CURRENT EPISODE. Your task is to extract **entity nodes** mentioned **explicitly or implicitly** in the CURRENT EPISODE.

1. **Entity Identification**:
   - Extract all significant entities, concepts, or actors that are **explicitly or implicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE.
   - For identity statements like "I am X" or "I'm X", extract BOTH the pronoun ("I") as a Alias entity AND the named entity (X).
   - For pronouns that refer to named entities, extract them as separate Alias entities.

2. **Entity Classification**:
   - Prefer using appropriate types from the ENTITY_TYPES section when they fit naturally.
   - DO NOT force-fit entities into inappropriate types from ENTITY_TYPES.
   - If no type from ENTITY_TYPES fits naturally, create a descriptive type based on context (e.g., "memory_graph_system", "authentication_bug").
   - Each entity should have exactly ONE type that best describes what it is.
   - Classify pronouns (I, me, you, etc.) as "Alias" entities.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions (predicates will be handled separately).
   - Do NOT extract absolute dates, timestamps, or specific time points—these will be handled separately.
   - Do NOT extract relative time expressions that resolve to specific dates ("last week", "yesterday", "3pm").

4. **Entity Name Extraction**:
   - Extract ONLY the core entity name, WITHOUT any type descriptors or qualifiers
   - When text mentions "Tesla car", extract name as "Tesla" with type "Vehicle" 
   - When text mentions "John's company", extract name as "John" with type "Person" (company is a separate entity)
   - **CLEAN NAMES**: Remove type words like "app", "system", "platform", "tool", "service", "company", "organization" from the entity name
   - **PRONOUNS**: Use exact form as they appear (e.g., "I", "me", "you") and classify as "Alias"
   - **FULL NAMES**: Use complete names when available (e.g., "John Smith" not "John")
   - **NO TYPE SUFFIXES**: Never append the entity type to the entity name

5. **Temporal and Relationship Context Extraction**:
   - EXTRACT duration expressions that describe relationship spans ("4 years", "2 months", "5 years")
   - EXTRACT temporal context that anchors relationships ("since moving", "after graduation", "during college")
   - EXTRACT relationship qualifiers ("close friends", "support system", "work team", "family members")
   - DO NOT extract absolute dates, timestamps, or specific time points ("June 9, 2023", "3pm", "last Saturday")
   - DO NOT extract relative time expressions that resolve to specific dates ("last week", "yesterday")

## Examples of Correct Entity Extraction:

**TEMPORAL INFORMATION - What to EXTRACT vs EXCLUDE:**

✅ **EXTRACT - Relationship Temporal Information:**
- Text: "I've known these friends for 4 years" → Extract: "4 years" (Duration)
- Text: "since I moved from my home country" → Extract: "since moving" (TemporalContext)  
- Text: "after that tough breakup" → Extract: "after breakup" (TemporalContext)
- Text: "we've been married for 5 years" → Extract: "5 years" (Duration)
- Text: "during college" → Extract: "during college" (TemporalContext)

❌ **EXCLUDE - Absolute Dates/Times:**
- Text: "on June 9, 2023" → Don't extract "June 9, 2023" 
- Text: "last Saturday" → Don't extract "last Saturday"
- Text: "at 3pm yesterday" → Don't extract "3pm" or "yesterday"
- Text: "next week" → Don't extract "next week"

**RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT ENTITIES:**
- Text: "my close friends" → Extract: "close friends" (QualifiedGroup)
- Text: "strong support system" → Extract: "support system" (RelationshipType)
- Text: "work colleagues" → Extract: "work colleagues" (ProfessionalGroup)
- Text: "family members" → Extract: "family members" (FamilyGroup)

**STANDARD ENTITY EXTRACTION:**
- Text: "Tesla car" → Name: "Tesla", Type: "Vehicle"
- Text: "Google's search engine" → Name: "Google", Type: "Company" + Name: "Search Engine", Type: "Product"
- Text: "Microsoft Office suite" → Name: "Microsoft Office", Type: "Software"
- Text: "John's startup company" → Name: "John", Type: "Person" + Name: "Startup", Type: "Company"

**INCORRECT Examples:**
- Text: "Tesla car" → ❌ Name: "Tesla car", Type: "Vehicle"
- Text: "authentication system" → ❌ Name: "authentication system", Type: "System"
- Text: "payment service" → ❌ Name: "payment service", Type: "Service"

 * Resolve entity duplications

  return [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a helpful assistant who determines whether or not ENTITIES extracted from a conversation are duplicates of existing entities.

## CRITICAL RULE: Entity Type Matters
DO NOT mark entities with different types as duplicates, even if they have identical names.
- DO NOT mark "John" (Person) and "John" (Company) as duplicates
- DO NOT mark "Apple" (Company) and "Apple" (Fruit) as duplicates  
- DO NOT mark "Core" (App) and "Core" (Concept) as duplicates

Consider entities as potential duplicates ONLY if they have:
1. Similar or identical names AND
2. The EXACT SAME entity type

Each entity in ENTITIES is represented as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    id: integer id of the entity,
    name: "name of the entity",
    entity_type: "ontological classification of the entity",
    entity_type_description: "Description of what the entity type represents",
    duplication_candidates: [
        {
            idx: integer index of the candidate entity,
            name: "name of the candidate entity",
            entity_type: "ontological classification of the candidate entity",
            ...<additional attributes>
        }
    ]
}

## Duplication Decision Rules
For each entity, determine if it is a duplicate of any of its duplication candidates:

### MARK AS DUPLICATE (duplicate_idx >= 0) when:
- Verify the candidate has the SAME entity_type as the current entity
- AND confirm the entities refer to the same real-world object or concept
- AND check that the names are very similar or identical

### SPECIAL RULE FOR PREDICATES:
**ALWAYS mark identical predicates as duplicates** - predicates are universal and reusable:
- Mark "is associated with" (Predicate) vs "is associated with" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0 ✓
- Mark "works for" (Predicate) vs "works for" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0 ✓
- Mark "owns" (Predicate) vs "owns" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0 ✓

### DO NOT mark as duplicate (duplicate_idx = -1) when:
- Confirm the candidate has a DIFFERENT entity_type (even with identical names)
- Identify they are related but distinct entities
- Recognize they have similar names or purposes but refer to separate instances or concepts
- Distinguish when one is a general concept and the other is a specific instance
- **EXCEPTION**: DO NOT apply this rule to Predicates - always deduplicate identical predicates

## Examples:

**CORRECT - Mark as NOT Duplicates (Different Types):**
- Set "Tesla" (Company) vs "Tesla" (Car) → duplicate_idx = -1
- Set "Apple" (Company) vs "Apple" (Fruit) → duplicate_idx = -1
- Set "Core" (App) vs "Core" (System) → duplicate_idx = -1

**CORRECT - Mark Predicates AS Duplicates (Same Name, Same Type):**
- Set "is associated with" (Predicate) vs "is associated with" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0
- Set "works for" (Predicate) vs "works for" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0
- Set "owns" (Predicate) vs "owns" (Predicate) → duplicate_idx = 0

**CORRECT - Evaluate Potential Duplicates (Same Type):**
- Check if "John Smith" (Person) vs "John Smith" (Person) refer to same person
- Check if "Microsoft" (Company) vs "Microsoft Corporation" (Company) are the same company
- Check if "iPhone" (Product) vs "Apple iPhone" (Product) are the same product

**CORRECT - Mark as NOT Duplicates (Same Type, Different Instances):**
- Set "Meeting" (Event) vs "Meeting" (Event) → duplicate_idx = -1 (different meetings)
- Set "Project" (Task) vs "Project" (Task) → duplicate_idx = -1 (different projects)
- **NOTE**: DO NOT apply this rule to Predicates - always deduplicate identical predicates

## Task:
Provide your response as a JSON object with an "entity_resolutions" array containing one entry for each entity.

For each entity, include:
- "id": the id of the entity (integer)
- "name": the name of the entity (string)  
- "duplicate_idx": the index of the duplicate candidate, or -1 if no duplicate (integer)

Format your response as follows:
<output>
{
  "entity_resolutions": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "Entity Name",
      "duplicate_idx": -1
    },
    // Additional entity resolutions...
  ]
}
</output>

## Important Instructions:
- FIRST check if entity types match before considering any duplication
- If entity types don't match, immediately set duplicate_idx = -1
- Only mark entities with identical types as potential duplicates
- When in doubt, prefer NOT marking as duplicate (duplicate_idx = -1)
- Always include all entities from the input in your response
- Always wrap the output in these tags <output> </output>
