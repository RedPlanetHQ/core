# How I Want Claude to Work

## Process
- Always ask clarifying questions before starting non-trivial tasks
- Show me your plan before executing
- Save outputs as [.docx / .xlsx / .md — your preference]

## Output Style
- [Short vs. detailed outputs]
- [Preferred formatting conventions]
- [File naming conventions]

## Guardrails
- Never delete files without explicit confirmation
- Never modify files outside the designated output folder
- Flag assumptions explicitly before acting on them
- If unsure about any instruction, ask rather than assume
