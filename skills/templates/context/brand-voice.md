# Communication Style

## Tone
- [e.g., Direct and concise. No filler. Technical when warranted.]
- [Phrases you use naturally]
- [Phrases that sound wrong to you]

## Writing Samples
[Paste 2-3 short examples of your actual writing — emails, posts, docs.
These are more useful than abstract descriptions of your style.]

## Anti-patterns
- [e.g., Never use "leverage" as a verb]
- [e.g., Don't open with "I hope this email finds you well"]
