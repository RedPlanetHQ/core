### Use Cases

#### Action Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Todoist tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create and Manage Tasks" icon="check-square">
    **Scenario**: Quickly add tasks with priorities and due dates

    ```
    "Create a high-priority task 'Review contract' due tomorrow
    with label 'urgent' in my Work project"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_task` with priority level 4, due_string "tomorrow", and the appropriate project_id and labels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize with Projects" icon="folder">
    **Scenario**: Structure work with projects and task hierarchies

    ```
    "Create a new project called '2026 Product Roadmap' and add three tasks
    for planning, development, and launch"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_project` to create the project
    2. Use `create_task` for each task with the project ID
    3. Use `update_project` to mark as favorite if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Task Progress" icon="list-check">
    **Scenario**: Monitor and update task status

    ```
    "Show me all active tasks in my Personal project,
    mark the completed ones as done"
    ```

    The agent will use `get_tasks` filtered by project, then `close_task` for completed items.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority Management" icon="exclamation">
    **Scenario**: Set and manage task priorities across your workflow

    ```
    "List all urgent priority tasks across all projects
    and update the ones due this week"
    ```

    The agent will use `get_tasks` to retrieve tasks, filter by priority level 4, and `update_task` to modify as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bulk Task Operations" icon="tasks">
    **Scenario**: Automate task creation and updates

    ```
    "Create five tasks for the weekly team meeting agenda
    and mark them all with the 'meeting' label"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_task` multiple times with consistent project_id and labels for bulk operations.
