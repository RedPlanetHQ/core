## Message Features

### Rich Embeds

Messages support rich embeds with titles, descriptions, colors, and fields for professional-looking announcements:

```
Send a formatted embed with:
- Title: "New Feature Release"
- Description: "Check out our latest update"
- Color: #5865F2 (Discord Blurple)
- Fields with inline content
```

### Text-to-Speech

Messages can be sent with text-to-speech enabled for important announcements:

```
"Send an announcement about a server maintenance window using text-to-speech"
```

### Reactions

Add emoji reactions to messages for quick acknowledgments, voting, or content flagging:

```
"Add a thumbsup reaction to the announcement,
and add a warning emoji to the spam message"
```

## Channel Types

Discord channels can be created as different types:

- **Text Channels (0)**: Standard message channels for conversation
- **Voice Channels (2)**: Audio communication channels
- **Categories (4)**: Organize channels into groups
- **Announcement Channels (5)**: Broadcast-only channels with cross-posting

## Role Permissions

Roles can be configured with granular Discord permissions:

- **Message Permissions**: Send messages, delete messages, manage messages
- **Channel Permissions**: Manage channels, create channels, view channels
- **Role Permissions**: Manage roles, mention @everyone/@here
- **Member Permissions**: Kick members, ban members, mute members
- **Voice Permissions**: Connect to voice, speak, use voice activity

Permissions are managed using Discord's bitwise permission system.

## Limitations & Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Discord API has rate limits; batching operations helps
- **Bot Permissions**: The bot must have appropriate permissions in the server
- **Message History**: Message retrieval is limited to channels the bot can access
- **Member Data**: Only accessible within servers where the bot is present
- **Token Refresh**: OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed when expired
