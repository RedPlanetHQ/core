When you ask CORE to perform Zoho Mail tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send and Reply to Emails" icon="paper-plane">
    **Scenario**: Send emails programmatically with multiple recipients

    ```
    "Send an email to client@example.com with CC to team@company.com about
    the project update, with HTML formatting"

    The agent will use `zoho_send_email` to send new emails with CC, BCC, and HTML formatting support, or `zoho_send_reply` to respond to existing messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search and Retrieve Messages" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Scenario**: Find emails using advanced search
