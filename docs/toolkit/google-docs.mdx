When you ask CORE to perform Google Docs tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Documentation" icon="file-word">
    **Scenario**: Create professional documents programmatically with structured content

    ```
    "Create a new document titled 'Q1 2026 Strategy Report',
    add a header section with formatted text, and insert our company logo"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_document` to generate the new document
    2. Use `append_text` to add content sections
    3. Use `format_text` to apply styling and structure
    4. Use `insert_image` to add the logo
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Edit Documents" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Scenario**: Modify existing documents with text insertions and replacements

    ```
    "Read the 'Meeting Notes' document, replace all occurrences of 'TBD' with 'To Be Determined',
    and append today's action items to the end"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `read_document` to understand current content
    2. Use `replace_text` to update placeholder text
    3. Use `append_text` to add new sections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Format Content" icon="paintbrush">
    **Scenario**: Apply professional formatting with consistent styling

    ```
    "Format all section headers in the document as bold 16pt text,
    make important notes italic, and highlight key metrics in blue"
    ```

    The agent will use `format_text` to apply styling including bold, italic, font sizes, and colors to specific text ranges.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insert Images" icon="image">
    **Scenario**: Embed visual content in documents for enhanced presentations

    ```
    "Insert the quarterly sales chart at the beginning of the report,

    The agent will use `insert_image` with valid image URIs to embed pictures, charts, or screenshots at specific locations with custom sizing.
  </Accordion>

    **Scenario**: Build automated document generation workflows for recurring reports

    The agent will:
