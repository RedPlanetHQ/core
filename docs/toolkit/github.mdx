## Use Cases

#### Action Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform GitHub tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated Issue Management" icon="ticket">
    **Scenario**: Automatically create and track GitHub issues from other tools

    ```
    "Create a GitHub issue in the 'core' repo titled 'Add user authentication'
    with the description 'Need to implement OAuth2 authentication'
    and assign it to @username with labels 'feature' and 'high-priority'"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_issue` to create the issue and can follow up with `create_issue_comment` to add additional context or use `update_issue` to modify details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull Request Review Workflow" icon="code-pull-request">
    **Scenario**: Review and merge pull requests directly from your IDE

    ```
    "Show me all open pull requests in the main repository,
    then review PR #123 and merge it if tests are passing"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `list_pull_requests` to fetch open PRs
    2. Use `get_pull_request` to get PR details
    3. Check `list_workflow_runs` for CI status
    4. Use `merge_pull_request` to merge after verification
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Search and Analysis" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Scenario**: Find specific code patterns across your repositories

    ```
    "Search for all files using the deprecated API endpoint
    '/api/v1/auth' across all my repositories"
    ```

    The agent will use `search_code` to find matching files and can use `get_file_content` to read the actual implementations for analysis.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Release Management" icon="rocket">
    **Scenario**: Automate release workflows

    ```
    "Create a new release branch 'release-v2.0' from main,
    update the version in package.json to 2.0.0,
    and create a pull request for the release"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_branch` to create the release branch
    2. Use `create_or_update_file` to update version files
    3. Use `create_pull_request` to create the release PR
    4. Use `create_issue` to track release tasks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Coordination" icon="users">
    **Scenario**: Track team activity and respond to notifications

    ```
    "Show me all issues assigned to me that were updated in the last 24 hours,
    and mark all my notifications as read"
    ```

    The agent will use `list_issues` with appropriate filters, `list_notifications` to keep you updated, and `mark_all_notifications_read` to clear your notifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CI/CD Pipeline Management" icon="gears">
    **Scenario**: Monitor and control GitHub Actions workflows

    ```
    "Check the status of the latest workflow run on the main branch.
    If it failed, rerun it"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `list_workflow_runs` to get recent runs
    2. Use `get_workflow_run` to check status details
    3. Use `rerun_workflow` if the run failed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Repository Setup Automation" icon="folder-plus">
    **Scenario**: Quickly set up new repositories with standard configurations

    ```
    "Create a new repository called 'my-new-project',
    add a README, create labels for 'bug', 'feature', and 'documentation',
    and set up a milestone for 'v1.0'"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_repository` to create the repo
    2. Use `create_or_update_file` to add the README
    3. Use `create_label` for each label
    4. Use `create_milestone` for the v1.0 milestone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Review Automation" icon="code">
    **Scenario**: Automated code review and feedback

    ```
    "Review the latest PR in my repository, check for any TODO comments
    in the changed files, and create review comments for each one"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `list_pull_requests` to get the latest PR
    2. Use `get_pull_request` to get changed files
    3. Use `get_file_content` to read files
    4. Use `create_pr_comment` to add review comments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Proactive Use Cases

With webhooks enabled, CORE monitors GitHub 24/7 and acts automatically based on your instructions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto-Triage New Issues" icon="ticket">
    **Trigger**: New issue created with specific labels

    **Automated Action**: Assign to team member and add to project

    ```
    "When a new issue is created with the 'bug' label,
    automatically assign it to @devops-team,
    add it to the 'Current Sprint' project,
    and notify me on WhatsApp"
    ```

    CORE monitors new issues and automatically routes them based on labels, keeping your team organized without manual triaging.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PR Review Notifications" icon="code-pull-request">
    **Trigger**: Pull request review requested

    **Automated Action**: Notify on preferred channel with context

    ```
    "When a workflow fails on the main branch,
    create a high-priority issue with the error logs,
    assign it to the last committer,
    and send an urgent notification to #engineering on Slack"
    ```

    Instantly respond to build failures. CORE creates issues, assigns responsibility, and escalates critical failures automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Release Tracking" icon="rocket">
    **Trigger**: New release published

    extract the changelog from the release notes,
    save it to CORE memory with label 'releases',
    and send a summary to #product-updates on Slack"
    ```

    Keep everyone informed on releases. CORE tracks release activity, stores release notes, and broadcasts updates across channels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Close Stale PRs" icon="clock">
    **Trigger**: PR updated after 30 days of inactivity

    **Automated Action**: Add comment and close if inactive

    ```
    "When a PR hasn't been updated in 30 days,
    add a comment asking if it's still relevant,
    and if no response in 7 days, close it with a standard message"
    ```

    Maintain repository hygiene automatically. CORE monitors stale PRs and handles cleanup based on your rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security Alert Response" icon="shield">
    **Trigger**: Dependabot security alert created

    **Automated Action**: Create issue and notify security team

    ```
