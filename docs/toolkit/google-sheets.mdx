## Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Google Sheets tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read and Analyze Data" icon="table">
    **Scenario**: Extract data from spreadsheets for analysis, reporting, or processing

    ```
    "List all my spreadsheets, then read data from the 'Sales Report' sheet
    in the Q1 2026 spreadsheet and show me the totals"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `list_spreadsheets` to find the spreadsheet
    2. Use `list_sheets` to discover available sheets
    3. Use `read_range` to get the data you need
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Spreadsheets" icon="pen">
    **Scenario**: Modify spreadsheet data programmatically with single or batch updates

    ```
    "Update cell B2 in the 'Budget' sheet to 50000,
    then update the entire row 5 with the new quarterly figures"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `write_to_cell` for updating single values
    2. Use `write_range` for updating multiple cells at once
    3. Use `batch_update` for complex operations with formatting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Reports" icon="chart-line">
    **Scenario**: Generate new spreadsheets for reports, exports, or data organization

    ```
    "Create a new spreadsheet called 'Monthly Sales Report',
    add headers in the first row, and populate it with this month's data"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_spreadsheet` with appropriate sheet titles
    2. Use `write_range` to add headers and initial data
    3. Use `append_range` to add records as they're generated
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Automation" icon="rotate">
    **Scenario**: Automate repetitive data tasks and keep spreadsheets synchronized

    ```
    "Read the current inventory data from the warehouse sheet,
    update the quantities based on today's orders, and write back the new values"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `read_range` to get current data
    2. Process the data with business logic
    3. Use `write_range` or `append_range` to update the spreadsheet
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    **Scenario**: Handle large volumes of data efficiently with batch append and update operations

    ```
    "Add 100 new customer records to the end of the Customers sheet,
    then format the header row as bold and sort by customer name"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `append_range` to add multiple rows of data efficiently
    2. Use `batch_update` to apply formatting and sorting in one operation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
