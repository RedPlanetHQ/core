## Use Cases

#### Action Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Google Tasks tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Manage Task Lists" icon="list-check">
    **Scenario**: Create and organize multiple task lists for different projects

    ```
    "Create a new task list called 'Q1 2026 Goals' and add three tasks
    with due dates for next month"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_task_list` to create a new list, then `create_task` for each task with appropriate due dates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Task Hierarchies" icon="sitemap">
    **Scenario**: Build and maintain task hierarchies with parent-child relationships

    ```
    "Create a parent task 'Launch new feature' and add three subtasks
    for design, development, and testing"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_task` to create the parent task
    2. Use `create_task` with the parent parameter for each subtask
    3. Use `move_task` to reorganize if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track and Filter Tasks" icon="filter">
    **Scenario**: Keep tasks organized with flexible filtering

    ```
    "Show me all incomplete tasks due this week across all my task lists"
    ```

    The agent will use `list_task_lists` to get all lists, then `list_tasks` with filtering parameters (showCompleted, dueMin, dueMax) to find matching tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize and Maintain Lists" icon="broom">
    **Scenario**: Maintain clean task lists by managing completed items

    ```
    "Clear all completed tasks from my 'Personal' task list"
    ```

    The agent will use `clear_completed_tasks` to remove all completed items from the specified list in one operation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Task Status" icon="check-circle">
    **Scenario**: Modify task details and status as work progresses

    ```
    "Update the task 'Write documentation' to mark it as completed
    and add a note about what was documented"
    ```

    The agent will use `update_task` to modify the task status, notes, and other details as needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Proactive Use Cases

With webhooks enabled, CORE monitors Google Tasks 24/7 and acts automatically based on your instructions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cross-Platform Task Sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Trigger**: New task created in specific list

    **Automated Action**: Sync to other task managers

    ```
    "When a task is created in my 'Work' task list,
    create a matching task in Todoist with the same due date,
    and if it has a due date within 3 days, add it to Linear as well"
    ```

    Keep task managers synchronized. CORE maintains consistency across all your productivity tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Completion Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    **Trigger**: Task marked as completed

    **Automated Action**: Log and analyze productivity

    ```
    "When I complete a task in Google Tasks,
    save it to CORE memory with label 'completed-tasks',
    track my daily completion rate,
    and send me a weekly productivity summary every Sunday"
    ```

    Measure productivity automatically. CORE tracks completions and provides insights on your work patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deadline Reminders" icon="bell">
    **Trigger**: Task due date approaching

    **Automated Action**: Multi-channel reminders

    ```
    "When a task's due date is tomorrow,
    send me an email reminder in the morning,
    add it to my Google Calendar as an all-day event,
    and send a WhatsApp notification 2 hours before end of day"
    ```

    Never miss deadlines. CORE sends timely reminders across multiple channels to keep you on track.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email-to-Task Conversion" icon="envelope">
    **Trigger**: Email received with specific label

    **Automated Action**: Create task automatically

    ```
    "When an email is labeled 'To-Do' in Gmail,
    create a task in Google Tasks with the email subject as title,
    add the sender's name in the notes,
    and set the due date to 3 days from now"
    ```

    Convert emails into actionable tasks. CORE bridges your inbox and task list automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recurring Task Management" icon="repeat">
    **Trigger**: Task completed with specific title pattern

    **Automated Action**: Create next instance

    ```
    "When I complete a task that starts with 'Weekly:',
    automatically create a new task with the same title,
    set the due date to 7 days from now,
    and add it to the same task list"
    ```

    Automate recurring tasks. CORE manages task recurrence based on completion patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Meeting Task Extraction" icon="calendar">
    **Trigger**: Task created with meeting context

    **Automated Action**: Link to calendar and prep

    ```
    "When a task mentions a meeting or has 'meeting' in the title,
    search my calendar for the relevant meeting,
    add the task notes to the calendar event description,
    and send me a reminder 1 hour before the meeting"
    ```

    Connect tasks to meetings. CORE ensures action items are visible in calendar context.
