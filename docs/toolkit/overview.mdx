## What is the Toolkit?

CORE's Toolkit is a unified actions layer — 50+ app integrations exposed through a single MCP endpoint. Any MCP-compatible agent can use it: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, CORE's own Agent, or your custom agents.

Connect an app once on the [CORE Dashboard](https://app.getcore.me), and every connected agent gets access. No need to build or maintain separate tool integrations per agent.

## Why Use CORE's Toolkit?

1. **One endpoint, all your apps**: Instead of configuring a separate MCP server for GitHub, another for Slack, another for Calendar — connect CORE once and get everything through a single endpoint. One connection, 15+ integrations.

2. **On-demand tool loading**: CORE doesn't dump all tools into your agent's context. When an agent needs to act, it describes what it wants to do. CORE filters and returns only the 1-3 relevant tools with their schemas. This saves thousands of tokens and keeps your agent focused.

3. **Works with any MCP-compatible agent**: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, your custom agents — anything that speaks MCP gets the full toolkit without extra setup.

## How It Works

#### Connect apps on the CORE Dashboard

Connect each integration securelt and authenticates via OAuth or API keys

#### Agent describes intent
When a user ask a question, agent sends an intent query e.g "send a slack message" and gets back only the relevant tool schemas.

#### Agent executes
Agent then calls the action/tools with the right parameters, CORE handles the rest
  
```
You: "Create a GitHub issue for the auth bug and message Sarah on Slack"

Agent:
→ Calls get_integration_actions("create github issue") → gets create_issue schema
→ Calls execute_integration_action(create_issue, {title, body, repo})
→ Calls get_integration_actions("send slack message") → gets send_message schema
→ Calls execute_integration_action(send_message, {channel, text})
```

## Connecting via MCP

All toolkit actions are exposed through a single MCP endpoint. Instead of configuring separate MCP servers per app, you connect CORE once.

**Base MCP URL:**
```
https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp
```

```
Traditional:  Your AI Tool → GitHub MCP Server (auth required)
              Your AI Tool → Linear MCP Server (auth required)
              Your AI Tool → Slack MCP Server (auth required)

With CORE:    Your AI Tool → CORE MCP Endpoint → All Integrations (pre-authenticated)
```

See [MCP Configuration](/mcp/configuration) for query parameters and [Authentication](/mcp/authentication) for OAuth and API key setup.

## Webhooks & Triggers

CORE also supports **proactive automation**. When events happen in your connected apps e.g new email, GitHub issue created, Slack message in a channel, CORE can automatically respond based on your configured triggers.

Each integration page below lists its available webhook triggers alongside its action tools.
