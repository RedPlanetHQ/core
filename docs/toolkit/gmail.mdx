## Use Cases

#### Action Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Gmail tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send and Draft Emails" icon="envelope">
    **Scenario**: Create and send emails programmatically with attachments and formatting

    ```
    "Send an email to client@example.com with subject 'Project Update'
    and attach the Q4 report PDF from my desktop"
    ```

    The agent will use `send_email` to send immediately with HTML formatting, multiple recipients (To, CC, BCC), attachments, and threading support. Use `draft_email` to create a draft for later modification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search Email History" icon="search">
    **Scenario**: Find emails using powerful Gmail search syntax

    ```
    "Search for all emails from client@example.com sent after January 1st
    that have attachments and contain the word 'invoice'"
    ```

    The agent will use `search_emails` with Gmail's query syntax to find emails by sender, subject, date range, attachments, and complex criteria with automatic timezone conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Labels and Filters" icon="tag">
    **Scenario**: Organize and automate email management

    ```
    "Create a label called 'Important Clients', then set up a filter
    to automatically apply this label to emails from client@example.com"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `create_label` to create custom labels for categorization
    2. Use `create_filter_from_template` to automatically organize incoming mail
    3. Apply filters to individual or batch emails for organization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Attachments" icon="file">
    **Scenario**: Download and manage email attachments

    ```
    "Find the latest email from finance@company.com with PDF attachments
    and download all attachments to my Downloads folder"
    ```

    The agent will first use `read_email` to get attachment IDs and metadata (filename, size, MIME type), then use `download_attachment` to save them to custom locations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Email Operations" icon="list">
    **Scenario**: Efficiently handle large numbers of emails

    ```
    "Find all emails from last month labeled 'newsletter'
    and delete them in batches"
    ```

    The agent will use `search_emails` to find matching emails, then use `batch_delete_emails` to process thousands of emails in controlled batches with automatic error handling and rate limit management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Automation" icon="bolt">
    **Scenario**: Build automated workflows for email management

    ```
    "Search for all unread emails from support@example.com,
    apply the 'Support' label, and mark them as read"
    ```

    The agent will combine `search_emails` with `batch_modify_emails` to search for emails matching criteria, apply labels automatically, and create filters for ongoing automation.

    apply the 'Newsletters' label,
    extract key headlines,
    save to CORE memory for weekly digest,
    and mark as read"
    ```

    Tame newsletter overload. CORE automatically categorizes, extracts insights, and organizes newsletters for later review.

    add it to Google Calendar,
    search CORE memory for past context with attendees,
    and send me a prep summary 1 hour before the meeting"
    ```

    Prepare for meetings automatically. CORE parses invitations, schedules events, and provides context from past interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Attachment Auto-Processing" icon="paperclip">
    **Trigger**: Email received with PDF attachment from specific sender

    **Automated Action**: Download, extract, and notify
