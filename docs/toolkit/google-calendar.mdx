## Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Google Calendar tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schedule Meetings" icon="calendar">
    **Scenario**: Quickly create a meeting with multiple attendees and send invitations

    ```
    "Create a meeting called 'Team Sync' next Wednesday from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM
    with attendees alice@company.com, bob@company.com, and carol@company.com.
    Add a Google Meet link and set a 15-minute email reminder"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_event` to create the event with all attendees, Google Meet conference link, email or popup reminders, and recurrence rules in RRULE format.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Availability" icon="clock">

    **Scenario**: Find available time slots before proposing a meeting time

    ```
    "Check my availability for January 20th from 9 AM to 5 PM,
    and show me all existing events for that day"
    ```

    The agent will use `get_freebusy` to check availability and `list_events` to show scheduled events, helping you find open time slots.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Recurring Events" icon="repeat">

    **Scenario**: Create recurring team meetings or recurring personal tasks

    ```
    "Create a weekly team standup meeting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
    at 9:00 AM for the next 12 weeks with the development team"
    ```

    The agent will use `create_event` with recurrence rules (RRULE format) to set up the recurring meeting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Calendar Management" icon="calendar-days">

    **Scenario**: Work with multiple calendars and check availability across them

    ```
    "List all my calendars, then check my availability
    across my work and personal calendars for next Tuesday"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `list_calendars` to see all available calendars
    2. Use `get_freebusy` with multiple calendar IDs to check combined availability
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quick Event Creation" icon="bolt">

    **Scenario**: Add events using natural language without specifying all details

    ```
    "Quick add: 'Lunch with Mark at Italian Bistro tomorrow at noon'"
    ```

    The agent will use `quick_add_event` to parse the natural language and create the event automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Meeting Details" icon="pen">

    **Scenario**: Modify an existing meeting time or attendee list

    ```
    "Update the Q1 Planning meeting to move it from 10 AM to 3 PM
    and add dev-lead@company.com as an attendee"
    ```

    The agent will use `get_event` to retrieve the event details, then `update_event` to apply the changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Find Meeting Slots" icon="search">

    **Scenario**: Identify available meeting times by checking free/busy across attendee calendars

    ```
    "Find a 1-hour slot on January 22nd when john@company.com,
    jane@company.com, and I are all available"
    ```

    The agent will use `get_freebusy` with all three calendar IDs to identify overlapping free time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calendar Cleanup" icon="trash">

    **Scenario**: Remove cancelled or rescheduled events

    ```
    "Delete the old 'Conference Call' event from January 10th
    and don't send notifications to attendees"
    ```

    The agent will use `delete_event` to remove the event without notifying attendees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
