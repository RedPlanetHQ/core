## Use Cases

#### Action Use Cases

When you ask CORE to perform Slack tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send Team Updates" icon="megaphone">
    **Scenario**: Broadcast important updates to specific channels

    ```
    "Send a message to the #announcements channel saying 'New release v2.0 is live!'
    then post the same message to #product-team"
    ```

    The agent will use `slack_send_message` to deliver updates to multiple channels, keeping teams synchronized on important news.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search Conversation History" icon="search">
    **Scenario**: Find past discussions and decisions

    ```
    "Search for all messages mentioning 'database migration' from the last week
    and show me who was involved in those conversations"
    ```

    The agent will use `slack_search_messages` to find relevant discussions and can follow up with `slack_get_message` to retrieve full context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Channels" icon="hash">
    **Scenario**: Create and organize project channels

    ```
    "Create a new private channel called 'project-alpha',
    add team members john, jane, and mike to it,
    and set the channel topic to 'Alpha project planning and tracking'"
    ```

    The agent will:
    1. Use `slack_create_channel` to create the private channel
    2. Use `slack_invite_to_channel` to add team members
    3. Use `slack_set_channel_topic` to set the channel description
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="React to Messages" icon="heart">
    **Scenario**: Acknowledge messages without creating noise

    ```
    "Add a thumbsup reaction to the latest message from @sarah in #general,
    and add a heart reaction to the announcement in #announcements"
    ```

    The agent will use `slack_add_reaction` to provide quick acknowledgments and emoji responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Important Channels" icon="bell">
    **Scenario**: Stay updated on critical conversations

    ```
    "Check #critical-alerts for any unread messages
    and get a list of the last 10 messages from #security-updates"
    ```

    The agent will use `slack_get_unread` and `slack_list_messages` to keep you informed on critical topics without missing important updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Proactive Use Cases

With webhooks enabled, CORE monitors Slack 24/7 and acts automatically based on your instructions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto-Capture Customer Feedback" icon="comment">
    **Trigger**: New message in `#sales-feedback` channel

    **Automated Action**: Extract insights and save to CORE memory

    ```
    "Whenever a message is posted in #sales-feedback,
    extract the key insights and save them to my memory
    with the label 'customer-feedback'"
    ```

    CORE monitors the channel and automatically captures feedback without manual intervention. You can later search and analyze patterns across all feedback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Release Notifications" icon="rocket">
    **Trigger**: New message in `#deployments` channel containing "released"

    **Automated Action**: Send summary notification via WhatsApp

    ```
    "When a release is posted in #deployments,
    send me a WhatsApp message with a brief summary
    of what was released"
    ```

    Stay informed on releases without monitoring Slack. CORE watches for deployment messages and notifies you on your preferred channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Message Routing" icon="envelope">
    **Trigger**: Direct message from specific users (e.g., your manager)

    **Automated Action**: Cross-post to WhatsApp with priority flag

    ```
    "If I receive a DM from @manager on Slack,
    immediately forward it to me on WhatsApp
    and mark it as urgent"
    ```

    Never miss critical messages. CORE routes important communications to where you'll see them fastest.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Onboarding" icon="user-plus">
    **Trigger**: New user joins `#engineering` channel

    **Automated Action**: Send onboarding resources and log to memory

    ```
    "When someone joins #engineering,
    send them our onboarding doc link
    and add their name to the team members list in my memory"
    ```

    Automate team onboarding. CORE welcomes new members and keeps your team roster updated automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Urgent Alert Escalation" icon="bell">
    **Trigger**: Message contains keywords like "urgent", "critical", or "down"

    **Automated Action**: Notify across channels and create task

    ```
    "If anyone posts a message with 'production down' in #alerts,
    notify me on WhatsApp immediately
    and create a high-priority task in Linear"
    ```

    CORE monitors for critical keywords and escalates issues across your entire workflow automatically.
