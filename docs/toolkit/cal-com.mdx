When you ask CORE to perform Cal.com tasks, it uses MCP tools to execute your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Manage Schedules" icon="calendar-days">
    **Scenario**: Create and manage multiple schedules for different purposes

    ```
    "Create a new business hours schedule for weekdays from 9am to 5pm
    in Eastern Time, and set it as my default schedule"
    ```

    The agent will use `cal_create_a_schedule` to create the schedule with the specified parameters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Availability" icon="clock">
    **Scenario**: Define recurring availability windows with day/time specifications

    ```
    "Update my schedule to be available only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
    from 10am to 3pm"
    ```

    The agent will use `cal_update_a_schedule` to modify the availability windows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure Meeting Types" icon="list">
    **Scenario**: Organize different types of meetings with specific schedules

    ```
    "Show me all my schedules and tell me which one is set as default"
