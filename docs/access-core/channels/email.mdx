## Overview

Send emails to **brain@getcore.me** and get intelligent responses from CORE's Agent. Perfect for longer requests, asynchronous workflows, or when you're already in your email client.

## Getting Started

Simply email **brain@getcore.me** from your registered email address. Your agent will:
1. Process your request
2. Search your memory if needed
3. Take actions across your connected apps
4. Reply with results and context


## How It Works

1. **Compose or forward** an email to brain@getcore.me from your registered account
2. **Add your instructions** in the email body (or just forward with a quick note)
3. **Include context** by forwarding email threads, attaching files, or referencing past conversations
4. **Get intelligent replies** with drafted responses, action confirmations, or requested information

**Email Forwarding Workflow:**
When you forward an email to brain@getcore.me, CORE preserves the entire thread context, making it perfect for:
- Setting reminders to follow up
- Extracting action items and creating tasks
- Getting summaries of long threads
- Drafting context-aware responses
- Saving important discussions to memory

## Use Cases

Also save this to memory under "partnership opportunities."
```

- Any recent discussions about changing them (check Slack #engineering)
- Related GitHub issues or PRs
```

**Extract Action Items from Thread:**
```
To: brain@getcore.me

[Forwarded meeting notes email]

Extract all action items, create Linear issues for each,
and send a summary to #project-alpha Slack channel.

**Get Context for Email Reply:**

## Response Time

- **Simple queries**: Usually within 1-2 minutes
- **Complex requests**: May take 5-10 minutes for thorough analysis
- **Batch operations**: Depends on number of actions (you'll get progress updates)

## Tips for Email Workflows

- **Forward liberally**: Forward any email thread to CORE for context, reminders, or drafting replies
- **Use subject lines**: Put key instructions in the subject for quick processing
- **Set follow-up reminders**: Never forget to circle back - just forward and ask for a reminder
- **Draft before sending**: Ask CORE to draft responses that need context from other tools
- **Batch forward**: Send multiple emails at once and ask for prioritization or summaries
- **Include deadlines**: "Remind me Friday" or "Follow up in 3 days" works naturally
- **Reference people naturally**: Use @mentions or names, CORE will map them to your contacts
