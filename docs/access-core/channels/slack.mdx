## Overview

Access CORE's Agent directly in Slack. Chat with your agent in any channel or via DM, take actions across your apps, and search your memory - all without leaving Slack.

## How to Access

You can interact with the CORE agent in two ways:

- **Mention in channels**: Use `@core` in any channel where the app is added
- **Direct message**: Open a DM with the CORE app and chat directly

<Note>
  The CORE app must be added to a channel before you can mention it there. Invite the app by typing `/invite @core` in the channel.
