## Two Ways to Use CORE

CORE is one intelligent brain with multiple access points. Choose how you want to interact based on your workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Talk to CORE" icon="messages" href="/access-core/channels/web-dashboard">
    **Direct conversation with your Meta Agent**

    Chat naturally with CORE's Meta Agent through your preferred communication channel. Your agent has access to memory, toolkit integrations, and can take actions across all your connected apps.

    **Perfect for:**
    - Quick tasks and queries
    - Managing your apps through conversation
    - Mobile and on-the-go access

    **Available on:**
    - Web Dashboard
    - WhatsApp (Private Beta)
    - Email (brain@getcore.me)
    - Slack (Coming Soon)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Add CORE to Your AI Tools" icon="plug" href="/providers/cursor">
    **Supercharge your existing AI workflows**

    Connect CORE to your IDE, coding agents, or AI assistants to give them persistent memory and the ability to take actions in your connected apps through MCP.

    **Perfect for:**
    - Coding with persistent context
    - Development workflows
    - Desktop AI assistants

    **Compatible with:**
    - IDEs (Cursor, Zed, VS Code, Windsurf)
    - Coding Agents (Claude Code, Cline, Roo Code)
    - Desktop Apps (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT)

## Understanding the Difference

### Talk to CORE (Channels)
When you talk to CORE through a channel, you're having a **direct conversation with CORE's Meta Agent**. The agent:
- Remembers everything from your past interactions
- Can access and search your memory graph
- Takes actions across your integrated apps (create Linear issues, send Slack messages, etc.)
- Works wherever you are - web, mobile, email

**Use this when:** You want to quickly get things done through conversation, check on past context, or need mobile access.

### Add CORE to Your AI Tools (Providers)
When you connect CORE to your existing AI tools via MCP, you're giving those tools **two superpowers**:
1. **Persistent Memory**: Your IDE or AI assistant can remember past conversations, decisions, and context
2. **Action Capabilities**: They can take actions in your apps (create GitHub PRs, update Notion pages, etc.)

**Use this when:** You're already working in an IDE or AI tool and want to enhance it with memory and integrations.

## Which Should I Use?

**Use both!** They're designed to work together:

- **Code in Cursor** with full memory of your project decisions → **Ask CORE via WhatsApp** about that bug you discussed yesterday
- **Chat with CORE on the web** to plan your day → **Execute in VS Code** with full context of what you discussed
- **Email brain@getcore.me** for a quick question → **Let Claude Desktop** access the same memory later

Your memory and integrations are shared across all access points. CORE is one brain - you just choose how to talk to it.
