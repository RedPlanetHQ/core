CORE is one brain with multiple access points. Connect it to messaging apps to use as your personal assistant, or plug it into AI tools to give them persistent memory and actions.

## Two Ways to Use CORE

### Use as Your Personal Assistant

Talk directly to CORE's Agent through messaging apps. Ask questions, manage your apps, get summaries, spun a claude code or browser session in your machine - all through chat, from any device.

### Supercharge Your AI Agents

Give any AI tool two superpowers: **persistent memory** across sessions and **actions** in your apps (GitHub, Slack, Linear, Gmail, and more). Connect once and every tool shares the same brain.

## Which Should I Use?

|  | Channels | AI Providers |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Chat directly with CORE's Meta Agent | Add memory + actions to your existing AI tools |
| **Best for** | Quick tasks, mobile access, managing apps via chat | Coding, development workflows, persistent context |

Use both - your memory is shared across all access points. CORE is one brain, you just choose how to talk to it.
