## What is the Meta Agent?

The Meta Agent is your personal AI — the intelligent orchestrator of your digital brain. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude that forget between conversations, the Meta Agent has persistent memory of everything you've discussed, decided, and built. It doesn't just chat — it thinks, remembers, and acts across all your connected tools.

Think of it as your chief of staff: it knows your preferences, remembers past decisions, understands your projects, and can take actions across your entire digital workspace.

## Core Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Natural Conversation" icon="messages">
    Talk to your Meta Agent like you would a colleague who knows your entire work history.

    **What it does:**
    - Understands context from your entire conversation history
    - Asks clarifying questions when needed
    - Provides detailed answers grounded in your memory
    - Maintains conversation threads across days, weeks, and months

    **Example:**
    ```
    You: "What did we decide about the authentication approach?"

    Meta Agent: "In your discussion with Sarah on Feb 8, you decided
    to use JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry and refresh token rotation.
    The decision was documented in Linear issue ENG-142 and discussed
    further in GitHub PR #234."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Memory-Aware Responses" icon="brain">
    Every response is grounded in your personal knowledge graph — your preferences, decisions, and past work.

    **What it does:**
    - Searches your memory graph for relevant context
    - Surfaces past decisions when facing similar choices
    - Remembers your preferences and applies them automatically
    - Links related information across conversations and tools

    **Example:**
    ```
    You: "Should we use REST or GraphQL for the new API?"

    Meta Agent: "Based on your past decision for the TaskMaster project,
    you chose REST for simplicity and predictable caching. You noted that
    GraphQL added complexity your team didn't need. However, you mentioned
    reconsidering it once the team grows beyond 5 engineers."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Actions Across Connected Apps" icon="bolt">
    Through the Toolkit, your Meta Agent can take actions in all your connected apps — no switching, no context loss.

    **What it does:**
    - Creates GitHub issues and pull requests
    - Sends Slack messages to channels or individuals
    - Updates Linear tasks and project statuses
    - Schedules calendar events
    - Drafts emails and documents
    - And 200+ more actions across 15+ platforms

    **Example:**
    ```
    You: "Create a Linear issue for the auth bug we just discussed
    and assign it to Sarah"

    Meta Agent:
    ✓ Created Linear issue ENG-143: "Fix JWT refresh token rotation"
      Description: Includes context from today's discussion and
                   links to related PR #234
      Assigned to: @sarah
      Labels: bug, authentication

    ✓ Also sent Sarah a Slack DM about the new issue
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Intelligent Scheduling & Automation" icon="calendar">
    The Meta Agent can work on your behalf, scheduling tasks and automating workflows based on your preferences.

    **What it does:**
    - Schedules recurring reviews and check-ins
    - Monitors connected apps for important updates
    - Sends proactive reminders based on your goals
    - Automates routine actions based on your directives

    **Example:**
    ```
    You: "Remind me every Monday morning about open PRs that need review"

    Meta Agent:
    ✓ Created automation rule
    ✓ Will check GitHub every Monday at 9 AM
    ✓ Will send summary of PRs awaiting your review
    ```
  </Accordion>

## Real-World Examples

### Engineering Team Lead

**Monday Morning:**
```
You (WhatsApp): "What happened in engineering last week?"

Meta Agent: "4 key updates:
1. Sarah completed auth refactor (ENG-142)
2. API v2 testing delayed - needs review
3. Tom asked about deployment pipeline changes
4. 2 critical bugs reported in production

Should I create a standup summary?"
```

**Tuesday Afternoon:**
```
You (Web): "Create a Linear issue for the API v2 testing delay and
schedule a meeting with the team for tomorrow"

Meta Agent:
✓ Created ENG-144: "Complete API v2 testing before Friday deploy"
✓ Scheduled meeting: "API v2 Testing Review"
  Tomorrow 2 PM, invited team@company.com
✓ Added meeting notes doc with context from last week
```

### Freelance Developer

**Project Kickoff:**
```
You: "Starting new project for Acme Corp - e-commerce site with
Stripe integration. I prefer Next.js and Tailwind."

Meta Agent:
✓ Created label: "Project: Acme Corp"
✓ Remembered tech preferences
```

**Two Weeks Later:**
```
You: "What's the Stripe integration approach I used last time?"

Meta Agent: "In your TaskMaster project (Nov 2025), you used
Stripe Checkout with webhook handlers. You noted that Stripe
Elements was too complex for your needs.

Code reference: /apps/taskmaster/stripe-webhook.ts"
```

## Behind the Scenes

When you interact with the Meta Agent, here's what happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Send a Message">
    Through any channel (web, WhatsApp, email), you send a query or command.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Intent Classification">
    The Meta Agent analyzes your message:
    - Question about the past? → Memory search
    - Action request? → Toolkit integration
    - Something to remember? → Memory ingestion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Memory Search">
    Classifies your [query type](/concepts/memory/query_types) (entity lookup, temporal, aspect query) and uses the right retrieval strategy — graph traversal, vector search, or BFS.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Execution">
    Determines which integration to use, executes with full context, and confirms completion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Memory Ingestion">
    Extracts new facts and entities, updates your memory graph, and links to existing context.
  </Step>
</Steps>
