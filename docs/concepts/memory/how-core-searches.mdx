## Overview

CORE's search is fundamentally different from traditional RAG. Instead of treating every query the same way, CORE first understands what kind of question you're asking, then applies the optimal search strategy for that query type. This makes searches 3-4x faster and significantly more precise.

## The Search Pipeline

When you ask the CORE Agent a question or search your memory:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Classification">
    CORE analyzes your query to determine the [query type](/concepts/memory/query_types) (aspect, entity, temporal, exploratory, or relationship), relevant time range, and which aspects to prioritize.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Strategy Selection">
    Based on the query type, CORE selects the search strategy:
    - **Aspect Query** → Filter by aspect, then vector search
    - **Entity Lookup** → Graph traversal from entity node
    - **Temporal Query** → Time-based filtering first
    - **Exploratory** → Recent session summaries
    - **Relationship Query** → Multi-hop graph traversal
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search Execution">
    CORE runs the search using a hybrid of three methods:
    - **Vector search** for semantic similarity ("what's my approach to error handling?" finds related content even without exact keywords)
    - **BM25 keyword search** for precise term matching ("Stripe integration" ranks documents with those terms highly)
    - **Graph traversal** for relationship discovery (follows entity connections across multiple hops)

    These run in parallel and results are fused together for optimal precision and recall.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relevance Ranking">
    Results are scored based on semantic relevance, recency, entity importance, label/topic match, and aspect priority. More recent facts rank higher while historical facts remain accessible.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context Assembly">
    CORE assembles the final response: groups related facts by entity or aspect, includes source episodes for traceability, and adds temporal context.
  </Step>
</Steps>
