## What Are Entities?

Entities are the nodes of your memory graph — the people, projects, companies, tools, and concepts that appear across your conversations. When you mention "Sarah" in a Slack thread, reference "TaskMaster" in a GitHub PR, and discuss "authentication" in Claude Code, CORE recognizes these as entities and connects them.

Every statement in your memory links back to entities. "Sarah works on TaskMaster" connects the Person entity `Sarah` to the Organization entity `TaskMaster` through a relationship.

## Core Entity Types

| **Type** | **Description** | **Key Attributes** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Person** | People in your network | email, role | "Sarah (Engineer, sarah@company.com)" |
| **Organization** | Companies, teams, groups | industry, size | "TaskMaster (Startup, Series A)" |
| **Place** | Physical or virtual locations | address | "San Francisco Office (123 Main St)" |
| **Event** | Time-based occurrences | startTime, endTime | "TaskMaster Launch (Q2 2025)" |
| **File** | Documents, code, and media | fileId, source | "Wireframes (Figma, Updated Daily)" |

## Application-Specific Entities

CORE also understands entities from your connected apps:

| **Source** | **Entity Types** |
| --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | Repositories, issues, pull requests, commits |
| **Slack** | Channels, threads |
| **Linear** | Issues, projects, teams |
| **Gmail** | Contacts, threads |

## How Entities Are Extracted

When CORE ingests a conversation, it automatically:

1. **Identifies entities** — Names, projects, tools, and concepts are recognized from natural language
2. **Resolves duplicates** — "Sarah," "Sarah Chen," and "@sarah" are linked to the same Person entity
3. **Creates relationships** — "Sarah works on TaskMaster" creates a `works_on` edge between two entities
4. **Updates over time** — If Sarah switches teams, CORE marks the old relationship as superseded and creates a new one with temporal metadata

This means searching for "Sarah" doesn't just find mentions of her name — it surfaces everything connected to her: projects, decisions, conversations, code reviews, and open issues.

## How Entities Connect

Entities form the backbone of your memory graph. Each entity can connect to:

- **Other entities** via relationships ("Sarah `works_on` TaskMaster")
- **Statements** that reference them ("Sarah prefers TypeScript" is a statement about the entity `Sarah`)
- **Episodes** where they appear (the Slack thread where Sarah was mentioned)

This structure enables [relationship queries](/concepts/memory/query_types) — asking "How do I know Sarah?" traverses the entity graph to find all connections: shared projects, conversations, decisions, and interactions.
