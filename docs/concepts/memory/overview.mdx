## Your Digital Brain's Memory

Memory is the foundation of CORE. It's a temporal knowledge graph that captures everything — conversations, decisions, preferences, relationships — and organizes it so the right context surfaces at the right time.

Unlike simple note-taking or RAG systems that store text chunks, CORE's memory understands *what kind* of information it's storing, *who* it's about, and *when* it changed.

## How Memory is Structured

Your memory is built from three building blocks:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Episodes" icon="clock">
    Raw conversations and interactions. Every chat, email, or synced app activity becomes an episode — the source of truth for everything CORE knows.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Entities" icon="users">
    People, projects, companies, and concepts in your world. CORE automatically extracts and links them across conversations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Statements" icon="quote-left">
    Atomic facts extracted from episodes. "Alex works on TaskMaster" or "Manik prefers TypeScript" — each traceable back to its source.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Every statement is classified into one of [11 aspects](/concepts/memory/aspects) (preference, decision, directive, etc.) so CORE can filter precisely — asking for your coding preferences doesn't surface your meeting schedule.

## How It Works in Practice

**Scenario:** You're working on an authentication bug.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Morning: First Mention">
    Sarah mentions the auth bug in Slack. CORE captures the conversation, links it to the authentication project, notes Sarah's involvement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Afternoon: GitHub Discussion">
    You discuss potential fixes in a PR review. CORE links the PR to the Slack discussion, connects technical approaches to team members.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evening: Quick Check">
    You ask CORE: "What's the status on the auth bug?" CORE searches memory, finds the Slack + GitHub context, and responds with a full summary — without you re-explaining anything.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next Day: Take Action">
    You say: "Create a Linear issue for the remaining work." CORE creates it with full context from yesterday's discussions, automatically linked to the right project and people.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How CORE Learns About You

When you first connect Gmail and Calendar, CORE scans your recent emails and events to build an initial understanding of your work. It extracts:

- **Who you work with** — team members, collaborators, external contacts
- **What you're working on** — projects, topics, recurring themes
- **How you communicate** — patterns, preferences, tone

This becomes your **persona document** — a living summary of your preferences, rules, and decisions that's automatically injected into your AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) so they understand your context from session one.

The more you use CORE, the richer this gets. Every conversation adds new facts, updates existing ones, and strengthens connections.
