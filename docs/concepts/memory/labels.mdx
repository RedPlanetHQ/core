## What Are Labels?

Labels are CORE's tagging system for organizing episodes, sessions, and documents. Think of them as project tags - you can apply multiple labels to any piece of content, making it easy to filter and find related memories across different contexts.

Labels are scoped to your workspace (unique per workspace, not global) and use a flat structure - no hierarchies, no nesting.

## Using Labels in Search

Labels make searches faster and more precise. When you filter by labels, CORE narrows the search space before executing - across all search methods (vector, BM25, graph traversal).

```
Query: "API design decisions"
Labels: ["Project: TaskMaster"]
→ Only returns TaskMaster-related API decisions
```

You can combine labels with time filters, aspect filters, or use multiple labels together.

## Creating Labels

From the CORE web dashboard, navigate to **Settings → Labels** and create labels with a name, optional description, and color. Labels appear in your workspace immediately and can be applied to episodes during ingestion or retroactively.

## Example: Organizing a Multi-Project Workspace

```
Labels:
- "Project: TaskMaster" (color: blue)
- "Project: CORE Features" (color: green)
- "Client: Acme Corp" (color: purple)
- "Topic: Authentication" (color: red)
- "Topic: Performance" (color: orange)
```

Keep labels concise and use consistent naming. 2-4 labels per episode is typical - don't over-label.
