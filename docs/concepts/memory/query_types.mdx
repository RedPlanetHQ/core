## Intent-Driven Retrieval

When you search your memory, CORE doesn't just keyword match. It first understands **what kind of question you're asking**, then routes to the optimal search strategy. Different queries need different approaches - asking for your preferences is fundamentally different from asking what happened last week.

## The 5 Query Types

### 1. Aspect Query

You're asking about a specific type of information.

- "What are my coding preferences?"
- "Show me my decisions about authentication"
- "What are my directives for code review?"

CORE extracts the relevant aspects (Preference, Decision, Directive), filters statements by those aspects, and returns structured facts.

### 2. Entity Lookup

You're asking about a specific person, project, technology, or concept.

- "Tell me about Sarah"
- "What do I know about TypeScript?"
- "Show me everything about the CORE project"

CORE finds the entity node in the graph and returns all statements where that entity is the subject or object, grouped by aspect.

---

### 3. Temporal Query

You're asking about what happened in a specific time range.

- "What happened last week?"
- "Show me my work from January"
- "What did we decide yesterday?"

CORE extracts the time range from natural language and filters episodes and statements by when they were recorded or when events occurred.

### 4. Exploratory

You're asking for broad context or a catch-up.

- "Catch me up on recent work"
- "What have I been working on?"
- "Show me my recent activity"

CORE returns recent session summaries grouped by topic - broad discovery mode with no specific filtering.

### 5. Relationship Query

You're asking about how two entities are connected.

- "How do I know Sarah?"
- "What's the connection between TypeScript and CORE?"
- "How is the payment service related to Stripe?"

CORE finds statements connecting both entities and can compute shortest paths between indirectly connected entities through the graph.
