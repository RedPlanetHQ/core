### What is CORE?

CORE is your digital brain — a temporal knowledge graph that remembers everything you do, learn, and build across all AI tools. Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget between sessions, CORE creates persistent, portable memory you own and control.

**Three layers:**
- **Meta Agent**: Your personal AI that uses memory to reason and act
- **Memory**: Temporal knowledge graph that captures facts, relationships, and evolving context
- **Toolkit**: Actions across 15+ apps — connect once, use everywhere

When you talk to Claude, code in Cursor, or chat on WhatsApp, CORE remembers. That context becomes accessible to every AI tool you connect, eliminating repetition and building knowledge that compounds.

### Who is it for?

**Developers** who switch between AI coding tools and want persistent context across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

**Teams** who need shared memory, decision provenance, and cross-tool knowledge continuity.

**Anyone** tired of re-explaining preferences, repeating context, or losing insights when switching AI tools.

### How it works

1. **You interact** via WhatsApp, email, web dashboard, or any connected AI tool
2. **CORE ingests** conversations, workflows, and app activity into a temporal knowledge graph
3. **Meta Agent reasons** using that memory to understand context, make decisions, and coordinate actions
4. **Toolkit executes** across GitHub, Linear, Gmail, Slack, Notion — whatever you've connected
5. **Memory compounds** over time, making every interaction smarter than the last

**Example:** You mention a bug in WhatsApp. CORE remembers it. Later in Cursor, you ask "what was that auth issue?" — CORE recalls the full context. You say "file a GitHub issue" — done. One memory graph. All your tools.

### The Compounding Effect

CORE gets better the more you use it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1">
    You discuss a bug with your team. CORE captures the conversation, technical decisions, and who's working on it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 4">
    You ask about deployment status. CORE already knows the context, team members, and related GitHub PRs — no re-explaining needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Month 3">
    You're debugging a similar issue. CORE surfaces the bug from 2 months ago with the solution that worked. New team members can ask CORE about your architecture and get full context.
  </Step>
</Steps>
