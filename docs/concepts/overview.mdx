## What Makes a Digital Brain?

A digital brain isn't just another AI assistant. It needs to do four things:

### It Remembers Everything

Nothing you say is ever lost. Every conversation, decision, preference, and relationship is retained - not as raw text, but as structured knowledge. It knows who said what, when things changed, and what kind of information it's holding (a preference vs. a decision vs. a goal). Ask about something from weeks ago and the answer is there, with full context of how you got there.

CORE implements this through a [temporal knowledge graph](/concepts/memory/overview) that captures, classifies, and connects everything over time.

### It Can Take Actions

Remembering is not enough if it can't act on what it knows. A digital brain should be able to perform actions on your behalf without you leaving the conversation.

Simple actions: create a GitHub issue, send a Slack message, add a calendar event.

Complex actions: research LinkedIn to find leads matching a criteria, add them to a Google Sheet, and send the sheet over Slack to your sales team — all from a single request. Multiple tools, multiple steps, orchestrated together with context carried through each one.

CORE's [Toolkit](/concepts/toolkit) gives the brain hands — 200+ actions across 50+ apps, all through a single connection point.

### It Thinks and Works Across Systems

Your tools are siloed. Claude Code can't talk to your WhatsApp. Cursor can't check your calendar. A digital brain breaks these walls — it can access and coordinate across all your agents and apps from any single interface.

Message the CORE Agent on WhatsApp and it can spin up a Claude Code session to fix a bug, start a browser session to research something, or pull context from memory - all without you opening a laptop. One brain that reaches into every tool you use, from wherever you are.

The [CORE Agent](/concepts/meta-agent) is this orchestrator - it understands intent, searches memory, picks tools, and coordinates across agents and apps.

### It Can Proactively Act

You shouldn't have to ask for everything. A digital brain monitors what's happening — a new email, a GitHub event, a calendar change — and evaluates it against what it knows about you: your preferences, your rules, your relationships. When the situation calls for it, it acts on your behalf. An email arrives from a client; your brain already knows how you handle that relationship and drafts the right response for your review.

CORE combines [CORE Agent, Memory, and Toolkit](/concepts/memory/overview#how-core-learns-about-you) to make this happen.

## How CORE Implements This

CORE's architecture has three layers that implement these four pillars:

  <Card title="CORE Agent" icon="brain" href="/concepts/meta-agent">
    The orchestrator. Understands intent, searches memory, routes to tools, and acts proactively. (Pillars 3 & 4)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Memory" icon="database" href="/concepts/memory/overview">
    The knowledge graph. Stores episodes, entities, and facts. Gets smarter over time. (Pillar 1)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Toolkit" icon="wrench" href="/concepts/toolkit">
    The actions layer. 15+ app integrations through a single MCP endpoint. (Pillar 2)
  </Card>
