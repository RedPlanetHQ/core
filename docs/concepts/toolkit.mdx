## Pillar 2: It Can Take Actions

The Toolkit is CORE's hands. While the Agent thinks and Memory remembers, the Toolkit actually *does things* — creates issues, drafts emails, schedules meetings, sends messages — across all your connected apps.

You connect each app once. After that, every interface to CORE (WhatsApp, web dashboard, Claude Code, Cursor) can use those integrations. One connection, available everywhere.

---

## How It Works

### 1. You Connect Apps

From the [CORE Dashboard](https://app.getcore.me), connect the apps you use daily. Each integration authenticates via OAuth — no API keys to manage.

### 2. Meta Agent Decides What to Use

When you ask CORE to do something, the Meta Agent figures out which integration(s) to use:

```
You: "Create a GitHub issue for the auth bug and tell Sarah on Slack"

Meta Agent:
→ Uses GitHub integration to create issue with context from memory
→ Uses Slack integration to DM Sarah with a link to the issue
```

### 3. Actions Execute with Context

Every action includes context from your memory. When CORE creates a Linear issue, it includes relevant discussion history. When it drafts an email, it knows your tone and past correspondence.

## How Toolkit Reaches Your AI Agents

Toolkit actions are exposed to AI agents through a single MCP endpoint. Instead of configuring separate MCP servers per app, you connect CORE once and any MCP-compatible agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) gets the full toolkit with on-demand tool loading.

See the [Toolkit Overview](/toolkit/overview) for details on how on-demand tool loading works and MCP configuration.
