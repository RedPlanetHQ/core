CORE's Agent is an always-on AI that remembers everything about you. Talk to it from the web dashboard or WhatsApp — it can answer questions, take actions, and manage things across your connected apps.

## Personal Assistant Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick channel to start talking to CORE Agent">
    - Web Dashboard — Go to [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me) and open the chat.
    - WhatsApp (Recommended) - Currently in private beta. Join the waitlist. Once approved, you can message CORE like any WhatsApp contact.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try It Out">
Try taking an action in gmail or calendar.

- *"What are my meetings for next week?"*
- *"Summarize my recent emails from last week"*

Connect Gmail, Calendar from Integrations section if you didn't gave scopes during signing up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Claude Code via Gateway (Recommended)">
Spin up coding sessions directly from WhatsApp.

Example: *"Start a Claude Code session to fix the auth bug in my repo"*

CORE can watch the session, report progress, and let you manage your development workflow from your phone.

Follow the [Claude Code setup guide](/providers/claude-code) to get started.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect More Apps (Optional)">
By default, CORE can read and act on your Gmail and Calendar. To expand what it can do, connect more apps from the [Toolkit](/toolkit/overview):

- **GitHub** — Create issues, review PRs
- **Linear** — Manage tasks
- **Slack** — Send messages, search channels
- **Notion** — Update pages, search docs

Each app you connect gives CORE more ways to help.
