Your ChatGPT and Gemini conversations contain valuable context — brainstorms, decisions, research — that's currently locked inside those apps. CORE's browser extension captures them into your digital brain, making them searchable and accessible across all your AI tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CORE Browser Extension">
    Download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/core-extension/cglndoindnhdbfcbijikibfjoholdjcc) and follow the [setup guide](/providers/browser-extension) to connect it to your CORE account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Existing Conversations">
1. Open **ChatGPT** or **Gemini** in your browser
2. Navigate to any previous chat in ChatGPT or Gemini
3. Click the **CORE logo** and turn on **Auto-Sync** for that conversation

That conversation context will be automatically saved to your digital brain.
  </Step>

    <Step title="Access Your Conversations Anywhere">
    Your ChatGPT/Gemini chats are now searchable in:
- **CORE Dashboard**: search and browse from the web
- **Claude Code**: reference past brainstorms while coding
- **Cursor**: pull in research context while building
- **Any AI tool** connected to CORE via MCP

Brainstorm in ChatGPT, build in Cursor — with full context from your previous conversations.

  </Step>
