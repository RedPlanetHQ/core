title: "Supercharge Your AI Agents"
description: "Give your AI tools persistent memory and the ability to act across your apps"
---

Your AI agents — Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop are powerful, but they forget everything between sessions. They can't send emails, create issues, or check your calendar. You end up re-explaining context and copy-pasting between tools.

CORE fixes both problems:
- **Persistent Memory** — Your preferences, decisions, and project context carry across every session
- **Toolkit Access** — Your agents can take real actions in Gmail, Calendar, GitHub, Linear, and more

Each provider has a dedicated setup guide. Setup takes 2-3 minutes.

## 2. What Your Agent Can Do Now

### Persistent Memory

Your agent remembers everything across sessions — your coding preferences, past architectural decisions, project context, team members, and workflows.

Try it:
- *"Search my memory for the auth architecture discussion from last week"*
- *"What was the decision on the database migration approach?"*
- *"What are my coding preferences for this project?"*

### Toolkit Actions

Your agent can now take real actions in your connected apps — things that were previously impossible or required constant copy-pasting.

Try it:
- *"Draft an email to Sarah about the Q1 roadmap"* (Gmail)
- *"Create a calendar invite for tomorrow at 2pm with the design team"* (Google Calendar)
- *"Create a GitHub issue for the performance regression we just discussed"* (GitHub)
- *"What's on my Linear board this sprint?"* (Linear)

## 3. Try Your First Action

Here's a concrete example using Claude Code:

1. Open Claude Code with CORE connected (ensure you have followed the setup guide)
2. Ask: *"What do you know about me?"* — Claude code searches from CORE info about you a
3. Ask: *"Draft an email to the team summarizing the changes we just made"* — CORE uses Gmail to compose the draft

Every conversation builds your digital brain. The more you use it, the less you need to explain.
