title: "Supercharge Your AI Agents"
description: "Give your AI tools persistent memory and the ability to act across your apps"
---

Your AI agents are powerful but stateless. Every new session starts from zero, you re-explain your project, your preferences, your decisions. CORE fixes this by giving any agent persistent memory and a toolkit of actions across your apps.

## Why Add CORE to Your Agents

CORE becomes your knowledge base over time. Every conversation, decision, and preference gets stored. Your agents stop being stateless and start building on what came before.

### For Coding Agents

Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf - your coding agent remembers project architecture, past decisions, and coding preferences across sessions. No more re-explaining context every time you start a new session.

You can also take actions without leaving your terminal or IDE — create GitHub issues, check your Linear board, send Slack messages — all from your coding environment.

### For General Assistants

Claude Desktop, Perplexity - CORE slowly becomes your knowledge base. It automatically stores your claude conversations and learn about your writing style, product context, business decisions, and product architecture.

You can also take actions in your apps - draft emails, manage calendar, create issues — directly from the conversation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your first memory">
    **Using a coding agent?** Ask it to summarize your codebase and save it:

    *"Summarize this project's architecture and save it to memory"*

    **Using a general assistant?** Ask it to surface what it knows:

    *"Tell me what you know about the product I'm working on"*

    Then open the [CORE Dashboard](https://app.getcore.me) and check how it was automatically added to your memory graph.

    Make sure you've followed the full setup guide for your provider, including adding [memory rules](/providers/memory-rules).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test an action">
    Try asking your agent to take an action in a connected app:

    - *"Create a GitHub issue for the bug we just discussed"*
    - *"Draft an email summarizing the changes we made"*
    - *"What's on my calendar tomorrow?"*

    Connect more apps from the [Toolkit](/toolkit/overview) to expand what your agents can do.
