> **Warning:**  
> You can self-host CORE on your own infrastructure using Docker.  
> The following instructions will use Docker Compose to spin up a CORE instance.  
> Make sure to read the [self-hosting overview](/self-hosting/overview) first.  
> As self-hosted deployments tend to have unique requirements and configurations, we don’t provide specific advice for securing your deployment, scaling up, or improving reliability.  
> **This guide alone is unlikely to result in a production-ready deployment. Security, scaling, and reliability concerns are not fully addressed here.**  
> Should the burden ever get too much, we’d be happy to see you on CORE Cloud where we deal with these concerns for you.


## Requirements

These are the minimum requirements for running the core.

### Prerequisites

To run CORE, you will need:

- Docker 20.10.0+
- Docker Compose 2.20.0+

### System Requirements

- 4+ vCPU
- 8+ GB RAM
- 20+ GB Storage


## Deployment Options

CORE offers multiple deployment approaches depending on your needs:

### Quick Deploy with Railway

For a one-click deployment experience, use Railway:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/core?referralCode=LHvbIb&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

Railway will automatically set up all required services and handle the infrastructure for you.

### Manual Docker Deployment

> **Prerequisites:**
> Before starting any deployment, ensure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` ready. This is required for AI functionality in CORE.
> You must add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `core/hosting/docker/.env` file before starting the services.

### Combined Setup

For self deployment:

1. Clone core repository
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/RedPlanetHQ/core.git
   cd core/hosting/docker
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Next Steps

Once deployed, you can:

- Configure your AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Set up integrations (Slack, GitHub, Gmail)
- Start building your memory graph
- Explore the CORE API and SDK
