## Overview

Integrating LinkedIn with CORE allows you to manage your professional presence directly through your Digital Brain. You can fetch profile data, share updates, and engage with posts using MCP tools.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Profile Management**: Fetch your professional identity and email.
- **Content Sharing**: Post text updates and images to your personal feed.
- **Engagement**: Like posts and add comments using post URNs.
- **Automation**: Schedule updates or respond to professional triggers.

---

## Prerequisites

Before connecting LinkedIn to CORE, you must create a LinkedIn Developer Application.

### 1. Create a LinkedIn Developer App
1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
2. Click **Create app**.
3. **App Name**: Enter "CORE Integration" (or your preference).
4. **LinkedIn Page**: LinkedIn requires a Company Page to "own" the app. If you don't have one, [create a dummy page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/). Paste the Page URL into the form.
5. **Privacy Policy URL**: You can use a placeholder or your personal website.
6. **App Logo**: Upload any square image.

### 2. Add Required Products
Navigate to the **Products** tab in your app settings and request access to:
- **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**: Enables `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes.
- **Share on LinkedIn**: Enables the `w_member_social` scope for posting.

*Note: Access is usually granted immediately.*

### 3. Configure OAuth Settings
1. Go to the **Auth** tab.
2. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. Under **OAuth 2.0 settings**, add the following **Authorized redirect URL**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3033/api/v1/oauth/callback
   ```

## Setup in CORE

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
Add your credentials to the `.env` file in the root of your CORE project:

```bash
########### LinkedIn Integration ############
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### 2. Connect via UI
1. Navigate to **CORE Dashboard -> Integrations -> LinkedIn**.
2. Click **Connect to LinkedIn**.
3. Authorize the application on the LinkedIn pop-up.

## Available MCP Tools

Once connected, you can use the following commands in any MCP-enabled environment (Chat, Cursor, Claude Code):

| Tool | Description | Required Args |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `get_profile` | Returns your basic member profile. | None |
| `get_email` | Returns your primary email address. | None |
| `post_update` | Posts a text update to your feed. | `text` |
| `post_image_update`| Posts an update with an image. | `text`, `imagePath` |
| `create_comment` | Adds a comment to a post. | `postUrn`, `text` |
| `like_post` | Likes a post. | `postUrn` |
| `delete_post` | Deletes one of your posts. | `postUrn` |

### Example Prompts
- "Get my LinkedIn profile info."
- "Post a LinkedIn update: 'Excited to announce I'm using @CORE for my professional automation!'"
- "Like the LinkedIn post with URN `urn:li:share:123456789`"

## Troubleshooting

### Redirect URI Mismatch
Ensure the redirect URL in the LinkedIn Developer Portal matches exactly: `http://localhost:3033/api/v1/oauth/callback`.

### Unauthorized Scope
Ensure you have added both **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** and **Share on LinkedIn** products in the Developer Portal.

### Internal Server Error (500)
Check your server logs. This usually indicates an invalid Client Secret or a mismatch in the OAuth protocol version. CORE supports the modern OpenID Connect scopes.
