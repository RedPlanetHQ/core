## Overview

The Browser capability lets CORE control browsers on your machine using [browser-use](https://browser-use.com/) under the hood. Each browser instance uses a **session** - a lightweight persistence layer that automatically saves and restores cookies and localStorage across browser restarts.

Login once, and CORE can access authenticated pages without re-authenticating.

For the full list of available browser commands, see the [browser-use documentation](https://browser-use.com/).

## Sessions

Sessions are the core concept. Each session automatically persists:

- Cookies
- localStorage

Use meaningful session names for different contexts:

```bash
# Open with a session name
corebrain browser open https://github.com --session-name work
corebrain browser open https://twitter.com --session-name personal

# List active sessions
corebrain browser list-sessions
```

Sessions are managed by browser-use's built-in session server, providing ~50ms command latency.

---

## Commands

### Open a URL

```bash
# Open with default session
corebrain browser open https://github.com

# Open with specific session
corebrain browser open https://github.com --session-name work
```

### Open CORE Dashboard

Quick command to open the CORE dashboard with a session selector (headed mode):

```bash
corebrain browser open-head
```

This prompts you to select a session and opens `https://app.getcore.me` in headed mode.

### Run Commands

Execute browser automation commands on an open session:

```bash
corebrain browser command click "#login-button" --session-name work
corebrain browser command fill "#email" "user@example.com" --session-name work
corebrain browser command screenshot --session-name work
```

See [browser-use docs](https://browser-use.com/) for all available commands.

### Close Browser

```bash
# Close a specific session
corebrain browser close --session-name work

# Close all sessions
corebrain browser close --all
```

### Manage Sessions

```bash
# List all active sessions
corebrain browser list-sessions

# Delete a session (closes browser)
corebrain browser delete-session <name>

# View status
corebrain browser status
```

## Gateway Tools

When the gateway is running, CORE can use these browser tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_open` | Open a URL with a session |
| `browser_close` | Close a browser for a session |
| `browser_command` | Run a browser command (click, fill, screenshot, etc.) |
| `browser_list_sessions` | List all active sessions |
| `browser_close_all` | Close all browser sessions at once |

---

## Use Cases

**Authenticated scraping:** Open a session, login to LinkedIn manually once. Now CORE can research leads on LinkedIn anytime without re-authenticating.

**Form automation:** CORE fills out repetitive forms - expense reports, time tracking, support tickets - using stored login sessions.

**Visual testing:** CORE opens your staging site, navigates through flows, takes screenshots, and compares them to baselines.

**Multi-account management:** Create separate sessions for different accounts (work, personal). CORE switches between them seamlessly.

---

## Prerequisites

The browser capability requires `browser-use` to be installed:

```bash
corebrain browser install
```

This installs [browser-use](https://browser-use.com/) and validates the installation with `browser-use doctor`.

### Verify Before Starting Gateway

**Important:** Before starting the gateway, verify that `browser-use` is accessible in your terminal:

```bash
# Check browser-use is in PATH
browser-use --version

# Run diagnostics
browser-use doctor
```

If `browser-use` is not found, you may need to:

1. **Reload your shell** to pick up PATH changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc for zsh
   ```

2. **Restart the gateway** after reloading:
   ```bash
   corebrain gateway stop && corebrain gateway start
   ```

The gateway captures your PATH at startup. If `browser-use` is installed after the gateway starts, the gateway won't have access to it until restarted.

### Recommended Browser

We recommend installing [Brave](https://brave.com/) as your automation browser. Brave is Chromium-based, so it works seamlessly with browser-use, and includes built-in ad blocking and privacy features that make automation cleaner and faster.

```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask brave-browser

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install brave-browser

# Windows
winget install Brave.Brave
```

After installing, configure browser-use to use Brave:

```bash
browser-use config set browser brave
```
