## What is the Gateway?

The Gateway is a local service that runs on your machine, connecting CORE to your development environment. It enables CORE to automate browsers, spawn coding agents, and execute shell commands - all triggered remotely from any channel like WhatsApp, the web dashboard, or another AI agent.

Think of it as the bridge between CORE's cloud intelligence and your local machine's capabilities.

## Why Use It?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Browser Automation" icon="browser">
    Control headless or headed browsers with persistent profiles for authentication
  </Card>

  <Card title="Coding Agents" icon="code">
    Spawn Claude Code or other coding agents on your machine from anywhere
  </Card>

  <Card title="Shell Commands" icon="terminal">
    Execute commands on your machine with configurable allow/deny patterns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the CORE CLI on your machine:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @anthropic/corebrain
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Login">
    Authenticate with your CORE account:
    ```bash
    corebrain login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Gateway">
    Set up your gateway with a name:
    ```bash
    corebrain gateway config
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Gateway Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `corebrain gateway start` | Install and start the gateway service |
| `corebrain gateway stop` | Stop and remove the gateway service |
| `corebrain gateway restart` | Restart the gateway service |
| `corebrain gateway status` | Check gateway status |
| `corebrain gateway config` | Configure gateway settings |

## Capabilities

The gateway exposes three main capabilities to CORE:

  </Card>

  <Card title="Coding" icon="code" href="/gateway/coding">
    Spawn and manage coding agent sessions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Exec" icon="terminal" href="/gateway/exec">
    Execute shell commands with security controls
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Use Cases

**Remote development:** You're on your phone, a bug comes in. Message CORE on WhatsApp: "Fix the auth timeout issue in the API." CORE spins up Claude Code on your machine, pulls context from memory, and starts working.

**Automated testing:** CORE opens a browser, logs into your staging environment, runs through a test flow, takes screenshots, and reports results - all from a scheduled reminder.

**Daily workflows:** "Every morning at 9am, check my GitHub notifications and summarize what needs attention." CORE runs commands on your machine to gather the data.

---

## Security

The gateway runs locally on your machine with configurable security controls:

- **Browser profiles** are stored locally and persist authentication
- **Exec commands** can be restricted with allow/deny patterns
- **Coding agents** run in isolated sessions with full audit trails

All communication between CORE and the gateway is authenticated and encrypted.
