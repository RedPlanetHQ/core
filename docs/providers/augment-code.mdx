description: "Connect Augment Code to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Augment Code installed
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

1. Open your Augment Code settings file at `~/.augment/settings.json`

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=augment-code",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "augment-code"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Augment Code: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask Augment Code to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the settings.json file is properly formatted
- Restart Augment Code after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
