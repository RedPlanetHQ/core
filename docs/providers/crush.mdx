### Prerequisites

- Crush terminal installed
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

Add the following to your Crush configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "mcp": {
    "core": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Crush",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "crush"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Crush: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core appears in your MCP configuration
3. **Test operations**: Ask Crush to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the configuration file is properly formatted with the correct schema
- Restart Crush after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
