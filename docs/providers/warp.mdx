description: "Connect Warp terminal to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Warp terminal installed
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

Add the following in Settings → AI → Manage MCP servers:

```json
{
  "core": {
    "url": "https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Warp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "warp"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Warp AI: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask Warp AI to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart Warp after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
