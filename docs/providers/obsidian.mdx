> Sync your Obsidian notes with [CORE](https://heysol.ai/core) (Contextual Observation & Recall Engine) and get **memory-aware answers** directly inside Obsidian.

## ✨ What it does

- **Sync Notes**: Push selected notes (or entire vault sections) into CORE as _Episodes_.
- **Right-Side Panel**: Opens a dedicated panel in Obsidian that sends the current note's content to CORE and shows **relevant results, links, or summaries**.
- **Frontmatter Control**: Decide which notes to sync by adding simple YAML flags.
- **Offline Safe**: Failed syncs are queued locally and retried automatically.

## 🚀 Installation

**Local development**

1. Download the latest release assets from [core-obsidian v0.1.1](https://github.com/RedPlanetHQ/core-obsidian/releases/tag/0.1.1) and extract them into your Obsidian vault under `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-core-sync/`:

   - Ensure the directory contains `main.js`, `style.css`, and `manifest.json`.

   > If .obsidian folder is hidden Use `CMD + SHIFT + .` to show hidden files and then add above files in `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-core-sync/`

2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Community plugins**
   - Find "CORE Sync" and toggle it on

**Community Installation**

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Step 1: Get Your API Key**

2. Navigate to **Settings** (bottom left)
   ![CORE Settings](/images/core-settings.png)
3. Go to **API Key** → **Generate new key** → Name it "obsidian"
4. Copy the generated API key

**Step 2: Configure Plugin Settings**

1. In Obsidian, go to **Settings** → **CORE Sync**
2. Configure the following:
   - **CORE Endpoint**: Your CORE ingest/search API (default: `https://app.getcore.me`)
   - **API Key**: Paste the API key from Step 1

## 🛠️ Usage

**Mark Notes for Sync**

Add the following frontmatter at the top of a note to mark it for synchronization:

```yaml
---
core.sync: true
---
```

** Manual Sync Commands**

Open the command palette (**Cmd/Ctrl + P**) and run:

- **"Sync current note to CORE"** - Sync the currently open note
- **"Sync all notes with core.sync=true"** - Sync all notes marked for synchronization

**CORE Panel with Deep Search**

1. Open the CORE Panel by running **"Open CORE Panel"** from the command palette
2. This opens a new tab on the right side of Obsidian
3. When you open or edit a note, the plugin will automatically:
   - Send the note's content to CORE
   - Display relevant memories, links, and summaries
   - Show related notes from your vault

The **Deep Search** feature proactively surfaces relevant context from your notes while you work:

**Example Use Cases:**

- **Meeting Prep**: Open your daily note before a 1:1 meeting, and the sidebar automatically shows relevant notes from past meetings with that person
- **Project Context**: Switch to a project document, and see related discussions, decisions, and action items from previous sessions
- **Travel Planning**: Update your packing list, and CORE shows you what you forgot on past trips or useful tips from previous travel notes
- **Research Continuity**: Work on a research note, and get automatic cross-references to related concepts and sources from your vault

Deep Search transforms your notes from passive storage into active assistance, providing in-the-moment retrieval without manual searching.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**API Key not working?**

- Verify the key is correctly copied from CORE dashboard

**Notes not syncing?**

- Ensure `core.sync: true` is in the frontmatter
