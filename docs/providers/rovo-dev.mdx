description: "Connect Atlassian Rovo Dev CLI to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Atlassian Rovo Dev CLI installed
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Edit MCP Config

Run the following command to open the MCP configuration:

```bash
acli rovodev mcp
```

This will open the MCP configuration editor.

### Step 2: Add CORE MCP Server Configuration

Add the following to your Rovo Dev MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "url": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Rovo-Dev"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Save Configuration

1. Save the configuration file
2. Exit the editor
3. The MCP server will be registered with Rovo Dev

### Step 4: Authenticate with CORE

1. After adding the configuration, Rovo Dev will prompt you to authenticate
2. When the authentication window opens, grant Rovo Dev permission to access your CORE memory
3. Complete the authentication flow

### Step 5: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Rovo Dev: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears in your MCP servers
3. **Test operations**: Ask Rovo Dev to store and retrieve information across sessions

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Rovo Dev, your development sessions will now:

- **Automatically retrieve** relevant information from CORE memory
- **Store important** context for future sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple development sessions
- **Share context** with other connected tools

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Verify you have the latest version of Rovo Dev CLI
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
- Restart Rovo Dev after configuration changes
