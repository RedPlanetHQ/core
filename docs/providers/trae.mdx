description: "Connect Trae to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Trae installed
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

Add the following to your Trae MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core": {
      "url": "https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Trae"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with CORE

1. After adding the configuration, Trae will prompt you to authenticate
2. When the authentication window opens, grant Trae permission to access your CORE memory
3. Complete the authentication flow

### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Trae: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask Trae to store and retrieve information across sessions

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Trae, your sessions will now:

- **Automatically retrieve** relevant information from CORE memory
- **Store important** context for future sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple conversations
- **Share context** with other connected tools

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart Trae after configuration changes
- Verify you're logged into your CORE account
- Check that Trae has the latest updates
