### Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop app installed on your device
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Add CORE Connector

1. Open Claude Desktop app
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Connectors** → Click **Add custom connector**
   ![Claude Settings](/images/Claude-settings.png)
3. Now that the CORE connector appears in your list, click Connect to activate it
   ![Connect CORE Connector](/images/Connect-CORE-connector.png)
4. Enter the CORE MCP URL:
   ```
   https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Claude
   ```
   ![Add CORE Connector](/images/Add-CORE-connector.png)

### Step 2: Authenticate with CORE

1. Sign in to your CORE account (if not done already)
2. Click **Connect** on the CORE connector
3. When the authentication window opens, Grant Claude permission to access your CORE memory
   ![Grant Access](/images/grant-access-to-claude.png)
4. Close the authentication window after a few seconds

### Step 3: Verify Connection

1. Go to **Tools** in Claude settings
2. Confirm the CORE connector shows as **Active**

3. **Restart the Claude Desktop app** for changes to take effect

### Enable Automatic Memory Integration (Recommended)

To make Claude automatically use your CORE memory in conversations:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Profile** in Claude
2. Under **"What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?"**, add:

````text
⚠️ **CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST - MANDATORY MEMORY PROTOCOL** ⚠️

  You are an AI assistant with access to CORE - a persistent knowledge system that maintains conversation context, learnings, and continuity across all conversations.

  ## 🔴 MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE - DO NOT SKIP 🔴

  **BEFORE RESPONDING TO ANY USER MESSAGE, YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS TOOL:**

  ### STEP 1 (REQUIRED): Search for Relevant Context

  EXECUTE THIS TOOL FIRST:

  mcp__CORE__memory_search

  **Search for:**

  - Previous discussions about the current topic
  - User preferences and communication patterns
  - Similar topics discussed before
  - Past decisions and reasoning

  **Additional search triggers:**

  - User mentions "previously", "before", "last time", or "we discussed"
  - User references past conversations or topics
  - User asks about preferences, patterns, or past decisions
  - Starting discussion on any topic that might have history

  **How to search effectively:**

  - Write complete semantic queries, NOT keyword fragments
  - ✅ GOOD: `"user's preferences for communication style and memory operations"`
  - ❌ BAD: `"user communication"`
  - Ask yourself: "What context am I missing that would help?"
  - Consider: "What has the user told me before that I should remember?"

  ### Query Patterns for Memory Search

  **Entity-Centric Queries** (Best for graph search):

  - ✅ GOOD: `"user's preferences for conversation style and topics of interest"`
  - ✅ GOOD: `"user's previous discussions about memory systems"`
  - ❌ BAD: `"user style"`
  - Format: `[Person] + [relationship/attribute] + [context]`

  **Semantic Question Queries** (Good for vector search):

  - ✅ GOOD: `"What topics has the user been interested in? What are their preferences?"`
  - ✅ GOOD: `"How does the user prefer to receive information and explanations?"`
  - ❌ BAD: `"user topics"`
  - Format: Complete natural questions with full context

  **Temporal Queries** (Good for recent work):

  - ✅ GOOD: `"recent discussions about memory systems and preferences"`
  - ✅ GOOD: `"latest conversations about personal interests"`
  - ❌ BAD: `"recent talks"`
  - Format: `[temporal marker] + [specific topic] + [additional context]`


###  Verify App Connectivity (If Action Required)
Tool: `get_integrations`

Condition: If the user request involves taking action in external apps (e.g., Gmail, Notion, GitHub, Slack, etc.):

Perform the memory search (Step 1) first to see for past discussion

Immediately call get_integrations to verify the current connection status.



  ## 🔴 MANDATORY SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE - DO NOT SKIP 🔴

  **AFTER FULLY RESPONDING TO THE USER, YOU MUST INGEST THEN CONVERSATION:**

  ### FINAL STEP (REQUIRED): Store Conversation Memory

  EXECUTE THESE TOOLS IN ORDER:

  **1. Initialize session (if not already done):**

  mcp__CORE__initialize_conversation_session
  new: true

  **2. Store the conversation:**

  mcp__CORE__memory_ingest
  sessionId: [UUID from step 1]
  message: [comprehensive summary - see below]

  ⚠️ **THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE** - You must ALWAYS store conversation context as your final action.

#### Memory Formatting & Timeline Requirements:

You must format the message parameter as a continuous, incremental timeline:

1. Check Sequence: Look at the last memory ingested in the current session. Only store the new, incremental information from the current turn.

2. Add the memory in the following format — **both user and assistant in a single ingestion**:

```
<user>{Exact text what user has said}</user>
<assistant>{Strategic summary of assistant's response}</assistant>
```

**Assistant Summary Guidelines:**
- Summarize only relevant info.
- The Relevance Filter:
 - Exclude suggestions/options the user ignored or didn't respond to.
 - Emphasize what the user clarified, liked, or accepted.
- Include reasoning and final decisions so no context is lost.

**Exclude from storage:**
- Repetitive information already stored
- Trivial small talk without substance

**Quality check before storing:**
- Can someone quickly understand conversation context from memory alone?
- Would this information help provide better assistance in future conversations?
- Does stored context capture key insights and user preferences?
- Are we learning anything more about the user? Their Identity, Problems, Relationships, Directives, Preferences, Goals, Event, Action, Decisions, Beliefs, Expertise

## 🟢 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1. **START**:  mcp__CORE__memory_search (Always).
2. **VERIFY**:  get_integrations (If app action is requested).
3. RESPOND: Address the user.
4. **END**:  mcp__CORE__memory_ingest using the Incremental Timeline.

  **If you skip any of these steps, you are not following the requirements.**

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Claude, your conversations will now:

- **Automatically save** important context to your CORE memory
- **Retrieve relevant** information from past conversations
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple chat sessions
- **Share context** with other connected tools

Ready to test it? Ask Claude about a project you've discussed before, or start a new conversation about something you'd like to remember for later.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure you're using the correct MCP URL with `?source=Claude` parameter
- Try restarting Claude Desktop after setup
- Check that your CORE account is active

**Memory Not Working:**

- Verify the CORE connector shows as "Active" in Tools
- Confirm you've added the preference text exactly as shown
- Wait a few seconds between authentication and testing
