description: "Connect Qodo Gen to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Qodo Gen installed (VSCode or IntelliJ plugin)
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Open Qodo Gen Chat Panel

1. Open Qodo Gen chat panel in your IDE (VSCode or IntelliJ)
2. The chat panel is where you'll configure MCP servers

### Step 2: Connect More Tools

1. In the Qodo Gen chat panel, click **Connect more tools**
2. Then click **+ Add new MCP**

### Step 3: Add CORE MCP Server Configuration

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Qodo-Gen"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Authenticate with CORE

1. After adding the configuration, Qodo Gen will prompt you to authenticate
2. When the authentication window opens, grant Qodo Gen permission to access your CORE memory
3. Complete the authentication flow

### Step 5: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Qodo Gen: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears as connected
3. **Test operations**: Ask Qodo Gen to store and retrieve information across sessions

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Qodo Gen, your conversations will now:

- **Automatically retrieve** relevant information from CORE memory
- **Store important** context for future sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple coding sessions
- **Share context** with other connected tools

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart your IDE after configuration changes
- Verify you're logged into your CORE account
- Check that Qodo Gen has the latest updates
