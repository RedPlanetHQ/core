description: "Connect Factory droid to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Factory (droid) installed
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Add CORE MCP Server via CLI

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
droid mcp add core https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Factory --type http --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "factory"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the command above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Type the following command within droid to manage servers and view available tools:

```bash
/mcp
```

You should see **core** listed among your MCP servers.

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask droid: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Run `/mcp` to verify core is connected
3. **Test operations**: Ask droid to store and retrieve information across sessions

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Factory, your droid sessions will now:

- **Automatically retrieve** relevant information from CORE memory
- **Store important** context for future sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple conversations
- **Share context** with other connected tools

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the command syntax is correct
- Check that droid is properly installed and up to date
- Verify you're logged into your CORE account
