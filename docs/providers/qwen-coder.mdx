---

### Prerequisites

- Qwen Coder CLI installed
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

See [Qwen Coder MCP Configuration](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/tools/mcp-server/#how-to-set-up-your-mcp-server) for details.

1. Open the Qwen Coder settings file at `~/.qwen/settings.json`
2. Add the following to the `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "httpUrl": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Qwen",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the `mcpServers` object does not exist, create it.

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "qwen-coder"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Qwen Coder: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask Qwen Coder to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the settings.json file is properly formatted
- Restart Qwen Coder after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
