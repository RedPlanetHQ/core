---

### Prerequisites

- VS Code Insiders installed
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Configure CORE MCP Server

Add the following to your VS Code Insiders MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "core-memory": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=VSCode-Insiders",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "vscode-insiders"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 3: Reload VS Code Insiders Window

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Run **"Developer: Reload Window"**
3. This will activate the MCP configuration

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask the AI assistant: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask the assistant to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the configuration file is properly formatted
- Reload the window after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
