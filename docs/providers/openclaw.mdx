---

CORE transforms OpenClaw into a persistent memory agent that automatically remembers conversations, recalls relevant context, and builds a comprehensive user profile across all sessions.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/RedPlanetHQ/openclaw) installed
- CORE account - [Sign up at app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the CORE Plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install @redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain
```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key

You have two options for providing your CORE API key:

**Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**

```bash
export CORE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Option 2: OpenClaw Configuration File**

Add to your `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain": {
      "apiKey": "your_api_key_here"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. Log into your CORE dashboard at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)
2. Navigate to **Settings** (bottom left)
3. Go to **API Key** → **Generate new key**
4. Name it "openclaw"
5. Copy the generated key and use it in Step 2

## How It Works

### Auto-Recall & Auto-Capture

The CORE plugin operates seamlessly in the background:

**Before AI Responses (Auto-Recall)**
- Automatically injects relevant past conversations into the AI's context
- Searches your memory graph for related discussions
- Provides the AI with your preferences and past decisions

**After Each Interaction (Auto-Capture)**
- Stores new conversations in your CORE memory
- Extracts key facts and relationships
- Updates your persistent user profile

This creates a continuous memory loop where every conversation builds on the last, across all your CORE-connected tools.

### Integration Support

Connect external services through your CORE dashboard, and OpenClaw's AI can:

- **Discover available actions** across your connected apps
- **Execute actions autonomously** - fetch GitHub PRs, create Linear issues, send Slack messages
- **Access real-time data** from all your integrated services

**Supported Integrations:**
- GitHub (PRs, issues, code reviews)
- Linear (tasks, projects, updates)
- Slack (messages, channels, threads)
- Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, and 20+ more

## Features

### 1. Persistent Memory Across Sessions

Your CORE memory includes:

- **Conversation History**: Every interaction stored and searchable
- **User Profile**: Automatically generated from your conversations
  - Preferences and coding style
  - Past decisions and their reasoning
  - Technologies and concepts you use
  - Goals and working patterns
- **Relationship Graph**: Connections between people, projects, and concepts

### 2. Semantic Memory Search

Use the `/search` command to find relevant context:

```bash
/search authentication implementation
/search discussions about API design with team
/search recent bug fixes in production
```

The AI can also search your memory automatically during conversations when it needs context.

### 3. Integration Actions

Execute actions in your connected apps directly from OpenClaw:

- Create and read GitHub issues and PRs
- Manage Linear tasks and projects
- Send Slack messages
- Draft and send emails
- Update calendar events
- Modify Notion pages and Google Sheets

### 4. User Profile Access

View your auto-generated profile:

```bash
/me
```

This shows your comprehensive user profile built from all your CORE conversations, including preferences, expertise, and working patterns.

## Available Commands

### Slash Commands

- `/search <query>` - Search your CORE memory semantically
- `/me` - View your auto-generated user profile
- `/integrations` - List all connected integrations and available actions

### AI Tools

The plugin provides these tools to the AI:

- **memory_search**: Semantic search across your knowledge graph
- **get_integrations**: Discover connected services
- **get_integration_actions**: List available actions for an integration
- **execute_integration_action**: Perform actions in connected apps

## Configuration Options

### Capture Modes

Configure how conversations are captured in your `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain": {
      "captureMode": "auto",
      "debugLogging": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Capture Modes:**
- `auto` (default) - Automatically capture all conversations
- `manual` - Only capture when explicitly requested
- `selective` - Capture based on conversation importance (coming soon)

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain": {
      "debugLogging": true
    }
  }
}
```

## What Makes This Different

**Traditional RAG**: "What text chunks look similar to this query?"

**CORE Memory Agent**: "What does the user want to know, and where in their organized knowledge does that live?"

CORE doesn't just search text—it understands intent, classifies queries, and retrieves exactly what matters. Your preferences from 3 months ago, the decision you made last week, the problem you solved yesterday—all connected and surfaced at the right time.

## Verify Connection

Test that everything works:

```bash
# Search your memory
/search recent work

# View your profile
/me

# List integrations
/integrations
```

You should see results from your CORE memory and connected integrations.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin Installation Issues:**

- Ensure OpenClaw is properly installed: `openclaw --version`
- Try reinstalling the plugin: `openclaw plugins uninstall @redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain && openclaw plugins install @redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain`
- Check that your OpenClaw version is up to date

**Authentication Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check that the API key is properly set in environment or config
- Ensure you're logged into your CORE account at app.getcore.me
- Try generating a new API key

**Memory Search Not Working:**

- Verify plugin is installed: `openclaw plugins list` should show `@redplanethq/openclaw-corebrain`
- Check that you have conversations stored in CORE
- Try manual search: `/search test query`
- Enable debug logging to see detailed error messages

**Integration Actions Failing:**

- Verify integrations are connected in your CORE dashboard
- Check integration permissions in CORE settings
- Test with `/integrations` to see available services
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in the target app
