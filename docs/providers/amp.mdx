description: "Connect your Amp code editor to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Amp code editor installed
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Install CORE MCP Server

Run this command in your terminal to connect CORE with Amp:

```bash
amp mcp add core-memory https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=amp
```

What this does: This command registers CORE's MCP server with Amp, establishing the connection endpoint for memory operations.

### Step 2: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Amp: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears in your MCP servers list
3. **Test operations**: Ask Amp to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure you're logged into your CORE account
- Check that the MCP server URL is correctly formatted
- Restart Amp if authentication seems stuck
