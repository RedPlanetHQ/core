---

### Prerequisites

- Cline installed (VS Code extension)
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))

### Step 1: Open Cline MCP Settings

1. Open Cline in VS Code
2. Click the **hamburger menu icon (☰)** to enter the MCP Servers section

### Step 2: Navigate to Remote Servers

1. Choose the **Remote Servers** tab
2. Click the **Edit Configuration** button

### Step 3: Add CORE MCP Server Configuration

Add the following to your Cline MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "url": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Cline",
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "cline"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 5: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Cline: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears as connected in your MCP servers
3. **Test operations**: Ask Cline to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
