description: "Connect Cline to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- Cline installed (VS Code extension)
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Open Cline MCP Settings

1. Open Cline in VS Code
2. Click the **hamburger menu icon (☰)** to enter the MCP Servers section

### Step 2: Navigate to Remote Servers

1. Choose the **Remote Servers** tab
2. Click the **Edit Configuration** button

### Step 3: Add CORE MCP Server Configuration

Add the following to your Cline MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "url": "https://app.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=Cline",
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Generate API Key

1. Log in to your CORE dashboard at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Key**
3. Click **Generate new key**
4. Name it "cline"
5. Copy the generated API key
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration above with your actual API key

### Step 5: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Cline: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears as connected in your MCP servers
3. **Test operations**: Ask Cline to store and retrieve information across sessions

## Enable Automatic Memory Integration (Recommended)

Create a custom rule file so Cline automatically searches and stores CORE memory.

### Create Memory Rule

1. Create the rule file at `clinerules/core-memory.md` in your project root:

```bash
mkdir -p clinerules
touch clinerules/core-memory.md
```

2. Add the memory protocol from the [Memory Rules guide](/providers/memory-rules) to this file.

Use this frontmatter for Cline:

```markdown
---
trigger: always_on
---
```

Then paste the memory protocol content below it.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Check that you're logged into your CORE account
