---

### Prerequisites

- Perplexity Desktop app installed
- CORE account (sign up at [app.getcore.me](https://app.getcore.me))

### Step 1: Add CORE MCP Server Configuration

1. Open Perplexity Desktop
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Connectors** → **Add Connector** → **Advanced**
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "core-memory": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.getcore.me/api/v1/mcp?source=perplexity"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Save Configuration

1. Click **Save** to apply the changes
2. The MCP server will be registered with Perplexity

### Step 3: Authenticate with CORE

1. After adding the CORE MCP server, Perplexity will prompt you to authenticate
2. When the authentication window opens, grant Perplexity permission to access your CORE memory
3. Complete the authentication flow

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Test your setup to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test memory search**:
   Ask Perplexity: `Can you search my memory for [something you've previously stored]?`

2. **Check connection status**: Verify that core-memory appears as connected in your connectors
3. **Test operations**: Ask Perplexity to store and retrieve information across sessions

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to Perplexity, your conversations will now:

- **Automatically retrieve** relevant information from CORE memory
- **Store important** context for future sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple conversations
- **Share context** with other connected tools

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed (required for npx)
- Check that the configuration is properly formatted
- Restart Perplexity after configuration changes
- Verify you're logged into your CORE account
