## Extension Features

The CORE extension currently works with **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** (more integrations coming soon). The CORE logo appears directly inside your chat interface, giving you instant access to memory features:

1. **Auto Sync**
   Toggle this on and CORE automatically saves your conversations to memory. Every brainstorming session, solution, or insight gets captured for future recall across all your tools.

2. **Add Space Context**
   Inject pre-built project summaries directly into your prompt. Create spaces in CORE for different projects or topics (e.g., "CORE Features," "Marketing Strategy"), then instantly add that full context to any conversation without retyping.

3. **Improve Prompt**
   Powered by CORE's Deep Search, this analyzes your prompt, searches your entire memory, and automatically enriches it with relevant context—making AI responses smarter and more personalized.

## Use-cases

With CORE connected to your browser, you can:

- **Brainstorm in ChatGPT**, then build in Cursor or Claude Code with full context
- **Stop re-explaining** your business, project details, or technical requirements—let CORE recall it
- **Build on past conversations** as every synced chat becomes searchable knowledge that surfaces automatically when relevant

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not appearing in chat interface:**

- Refresh your ChatGPT or Gemini page after installation
- Ensure the extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings

**API key not working:**

- Verify the key is correctly copied from CORE dashboard
- Check that your CORE account is active
